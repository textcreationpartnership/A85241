            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Tranſcription of the following Treatiſe is an Account of ſome vacant time, when I was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſterd from other imployment: The ſubject matter of it did generally concur and ſute with that ſtate and meaſure of Faith I was then in; and being perſwaded that it may yet be uſefull for them whoſe growth in the Myſterie of the Croſs is not come to that perfection as not to need Counſell and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement therein, I have for their ſake made it publique. And though I cannot miniſter to the ſtrong, yet I would gladly be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the weak. What I have here prefixt, (agreeable to the nature of the enſuing Diſcourſe) is done to ſatisfie the deſire of many friends, and in hope to profit others. The ſum of what I have to ſay, is comprehended in this Propoſition,
<hi>viz.</hi> That there is a Neceſſity of knowing and conforming unto the death of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There doth not want full and pregnant proof of Scripture to confirm the Truth of this Propoſition; It is a faithfull ſaying, <hi>For if we be dead with him, we ſhall alſo live with him; If we ſuffer, we ſhall alſo reign with him; If we deny him, he alſo
<pb facs="tcp:171778:3"/> will deny us,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.11,12. <hi>For if we have been planted to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the likeneſs of his death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If we be dead with Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 6.5,8. Let none dream of Juſtification unto life, or of the new birth which only entereth into the Kingdom of God, without the likeneſs and image of Chriſt in his humiliation. And therefore the Apoſtle doth not content himſelf with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge only that Chriſt died, but deſires alſo a conformity to his death, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.10. A ſtrong curb and ſmart ſcourge to all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and licentious Gospellers. The reaſons alſo of this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are weighty and conſiderable:
<note place="margin">1.</note>As firſt,</p>
               <p n="3">3. We can have no benefit of the life of Chriſt, but by confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his death. <hi>Always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jeſus, that the life alſo of Jeſus might be manifeſt in our body,</hi> &amp;c. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.10,11. What need we carry the death, dying, and marks of the Lord Jeſus in our body and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal fleſh, if the life of Chriſt could otherwiſe or more eaſily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear? <hi>The life of a Believer is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3.3. <hi>There's no coming at the full Glory of this life, but by breaking thorow death unto it:</hi> See Rom. 6.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the place before cited. <hi>The dead men of God are quickned by the dead body of Chriſt,</hi> Iſa. 26.19. No future Reſurrection unto life, but by an antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent death in the body: <hi>Except the grain of Wheat die, it abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth alone, and is not quickened,</hi> John
12.24. 1 Cor. 15.36. <hi>The touch of a dead Prophet revived the body of another dead man,</hi> 2 King. 13.21. Who is this dead Prophet, but the true and ſpiritual <hi>Eliſha,</hi> my Lord that ſaveth, the Lord of my ſalvation, my ſaving Lord, Jeſus Chriſt the great Prophet of the moſt high God, <hi>who died for our ſins, and was raiſed again for our Juſtification?</hi> This <hi>Eliſha,</hi> this Jeſus let us follow, not only from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but from
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> alſo here below, the outward and litteral Service, and Worſhip, unto Mount <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,</hi> and from thence to the Sepulchre; thither let us haſten with <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> aad the two other Diſciples, and there let us wait; we ſhall have ſome Angelical invitation to come near, and ſee the place where the Lord lay. The Lord is riſen, and hath left room enough in his grave to receive all that inquire into the Myſterie of his death. Into this Sepulchre let us deſcend by a true operating ſaith, working a conformity in us unto his death: Let us touch, not the fleſh, but the bones of this great <hi>Eliſha;</hi> Let us not
<pb facs="tcp:171778:3"/> lay bold on the weakneſs of the mortal nature, but upon the Power of his endleſs life.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly,</p>
               <p n="4">4. Without this conformity there is no freedom from ſin. We muſt reſiſt unto <hi>Blood,</hi> ſtriving againſt ſin; for without blood there is no Remiſſion: And that our minds may not be weary, nor faint, <hi>Let us conſider him that ſuffered ſuch contradiction of ſinners,</hi> Heb. 12.3,4. 1 John 1.7. Lev. 17.11. Heb. 9.22. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ezekiel</hi> deſcribeth the Sickneſs and Remedy of a ſinner under the borrowed ſpeech of a new-born Child, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. Which place of the Prophet, (I think) is much miſtaken by many, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it of the natural birth, and accordingly from thence conclude all Children guilty of original ſin in the common acceptation of it: which to me ſeems moſt improbable. For Children, by natural as well as ſpiritual Propagation,
<hi>are an Heritage and Reward of the Lord,</hi> Gen. 30.2. Pſalm 127.3.
<note place="margin">Acts 17.28.</note>
                  <hi>Our very bodily Being, Subſtance and Exiſtence is the Workmanſhip of God,</hi> Pſalm 119.73. &amp; Pſalm 139.5,13,16. Now if Children be guilty of ſin as ſoon as they draw breath, yea, before they be born, this would be ſome ſtain upon the Work-manſhip of God, according to whoſe Will, and not according to mans, it is that Children are propagated. Again, One of Gods Laws would be broken by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving another Ordinance of his own, which would bring confuſion upon the orderly works and methodical ways of God. For God hath made a Law, <hi>That the ſon ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Father,</hi> Ezek. 18.20. Now if Children ſhould be guilty of <hi>Adams</hi> ſia as ſoon as they be born, it would make many religious and conſciencious perſons be at a ſtand concerning marriage, which is the firſt and great Ordinance of God, for fear leſt they ſhould be Inſtruments to fill the world with ſinners, rather than with Saints. And indeed how can that ſtate be honorable, and the bed undefiled, if it ſhould produce nothing but ſuch an unclean Off-ſpring?
<hi>Heb.</hi> 13.4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. I ſhall only add this Quaere, <hi>viz</hi> Is Marriage an Ordinance of God inſtituted (among other ends) for the propagation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind? I ſuppoſe it granted. I ask then, Did God ever make and intend ſuch an Ordinance, the obſervation whereof doth unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably increaſe ſin in the world? If ſo, How is he acquited fram having a hand in mans ſin? The wicked heart of man hath ſhifts and evaſions to extenuate and excuſe his ſin. Why, He is not ſo
<pb facs="tcp:171778:4"/> much to be blamed; 'twas his Fathers and Mothers fault rather then his;

Nay, rather then take ſhame to himſelf, God muſt bear the blame of all, as one that deſtin'd him to that Event: And this is not counted for Blaſphemy. Well, But if thou couldſt not hinder or prevent thy Fathers fault, muſt thou needs commit the ſame thy ſelf? Why wilt thou marry to make the world more ſinfull, and cauſe thy Children to cry out againſt thee for infecting them with ſin? But he that can underſtand the fifth Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and alſo
<hi>Wiſdom</hi> 7. &amp; 8. <hi>Chap.</hi> he will not be bound to the Traditions of men concerning original ſin. Wherefore when we find ſin in us, let us not complain of our Parents; curſe not the very Devil, leſt it fall on thy ſelf, <hi>Ecclus.</hi> 21.27. Much leſs impute it to God,
<hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13,14. But let us take ſhame to our ſelves: this will keep us low, and humble, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full over our ſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">6. If any ſhall object, and ſay, that Children cannot come clean into the world becauſe of the uncleanneſs of their Parents, who are the Inſtruments of their Propagation, for which they urge
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 51.5. <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquity, in ſin did my mother warm me.</hi> I anſwer, (1) With the Examiners of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines Confeſſion of Faith: Had <hi>David</hi> no father and another but
<hi>Jeſſe</hi> and his wife? (2) What if <hi>David</hi> (like his ſon
<hi>Solomon</hi>) was faſhioned in the womb to be fleſh, and compacted in blood, (<hi>Wiſd.</hi> 7.2.) Doth it therefore follow that he was made ſinfull, and born ſinfully unclean? Might he not have a good ſpirit and a clean ſoul breathed into an undefiled body? <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 8.19,20. Is not a freſh fiſh ſpawned in the brackiſh ſea? And when the ſpirit of life enters into it, doth the ſalt water change the freſh property of its nature? It is God that formeth us in the belly, we are his work-manſhip, and be (though none but he) can bring a clean thing out of that which is unclean;
<hi>His work is perfect, Deut.</hi> 32.4. He can produce a freſh fiſh in a briniſh ſea. But, (3) If the ſtrength of the Argument for a perſonal pollution of Children in their conception and birth do lie in this Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Inſtruments of their generation are unclean, and from hence an affirmative concluſion be inferred, <hi>viz.</hi> Therefore the Children alſo muſt be inherently and really ſinfull; then I ſay a very great inconvenience (if not a groſs abſurdity) will follow from the like
<pb facs="tcp:171778:4"/> way of arguing in a matter of greater moment. As for example: The Redemption of mankind by the blood of Chriſt was a pure, perfect, holy and undefiled work; and the fore Knowledge, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Purpoſe of God that he ſhould be delivered to death was an unſpotted Act in God; yet the death of Chriſt being effected and brought about by the Interpoſition and Conjuction of wicked hands, (<hi>Acts</hi> 2.23.) that oblation of Chriſt for ſin to work out our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, muſt (if the former reaſoning hold good) be ſtained, and conſequently become imperfect and inſufficient to accompliſh that which he did intend and undertake, by reaſon of thoſe wicked Inſtruments which had a hand in bringing it to paſs. Now if there be ſuch a Critical and Spagyrick skill in the divine Wiſdom as to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the <hi>precious</hi> thoughts of God, and keep them diſtinct from the <hi>vile</hi> plots and purpoſes of wicked men in the ſin-offering of Chriſt, whereby that ſacrifice became no way defective; why can he not bring forth Children of the womb, which are the work of his hands, without any hereditary defilement, notwithſtanding the inordinate affections and unruly paſſions of their parents? (4) Add hereunto, That there is a ſpiritual begetting of a holy ſeed and righteous people into the life of God, a nouriſhing of their Faith, Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in that life unto a full meaſure, and perfect growth, and ſtature of Chriſt by the Spirit &amp; Word of God in the true preaching of the true Gospel, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11,12,13 <hi>Col.</hi> 1.28. So that the ſtate and life of a Believer (as a Believer) muſt be perfect here or never, unleſs we grant a Purgatory. Which ſtate and life of the Believer is here compleated by the concurrence and co-operation of the Miniſters of Chriſt,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. But theſe Preachers you will ſay (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of thoſe who ſay, there is, or can be none per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect upon earth) are not without their particular failings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, none of them; no, not the beſt of them: and yet you dare not deny but that the work of God in their Repentance, Faith, Hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is perfect, notwithſtanding the Miniſters imperfection. If the wiſe and holy God knows how to diſtinguiſh the work of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Grace, and preſerve it intire and pure from tht Obliquity of the Creature in the greater and more difficult work; can he not do ſo in things of leſſer moment? For doubtleſs the Serpent is more deſirous and induſtrious to blend and mingle his lyes, and the deceit of his falſe Prophets with the Truth of God in the Converſion of a ſinner, then he is ſtudious and diligent to defile the minds of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb facs="tcp:171778:5"/> and inject a venomous quality into their Children in the womb; (although his malicious endeavour is not wanting in this alſo) becauſe he well knows, that if a man be once turned from the error of his ways, and perfectly united unto God, he is then quite out of his reach, he hath no hopes of ever gaining ſuch a one: but though God bring a man as clean into the world as he did <hi>Adam,</hi> yet he thinks he may have time and opportunity to ſeduce him by his ſubtilty, as well as he did prevail againſt <hi>Eve</hi> in the beginning. Again, (5) Let it be granted that ſome Children are, and have been conceived and brought forth guilty of their parents ſin; it doth not follow that all have been, and are ſo born, unleſs you conclude with the fore-mentioned ſort of men, that there are none ſo redeemed and ſanctified as to know one another with pure and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled ſouls: or elſe that there is no ſuch mutual Knowledge after Converſion and Regeneration, which you will not (I ſuppoſe) affirm: Or elſe you muſt ſay that a good Tree and pure fountain may ſend forth bad fruit and filthy water. True it is, That <hi>Eve</hi> brought forth her eldeſt child, and called his name <hi>Cain,</hi> a wicked man, in the figure of the fall, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.1.

<pb facs="tcp:171778:9"/> lie down at the feet of Chriſt, and deſire him to caſt the skirt of his garment over us, as one nigh of kin unto us.

               <p n="20">20. What cenſure ſoever the eight firſt Degrees may undergo, as <hi>Cabaliſtical</hi> conceits, is not much material: There can be no Dſpute about the two laſt by any that acknowledge Chriſt to be come in the fleſh. For he was truly a man in our nature, with which nature of ours he harneſſed himſelf, <hi>like a man of War,</hi> (Exod. 15.3.) and fought it out hand to fiſt in a ſingle Duel with the Devil; in which Combate he ſtood it out unto the death, and thereby overcame him that had the power of death, to wit, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>And withal vanquiſhing death and hell,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.55. Hoſ. 13.14.
<note place="margin">Read Col. 2.14,15.</note> Thus he put off his harneſs of fleſh and blood, (of which he took part with the Children,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 2.) as well as put it on; <hi>No man took it from him,</hi> 1 Kings 20.11. John 10.18.</p>
               <p n="21">21. Thus Chriſt when he was in the height of his perfection, in perfect Glory, filling all in all, the fulneſs and end of the Law for Righteouſneſs, the Law-giver above the Law, <hi>yet in the fulneſs of time was made of a woman, made under the Law, became a curſe for us, to redeem us from the curſe of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.13. &amp;
<hi>chap.</hi> 4.4. By this going back-ward of Chriſt unto the tenth degree of death, we have hope of life to come. His going back-ward was his progreſs to his journeyes end; for his ways are not our ways, but rather contrary to them. Thus our true <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> having been in priſon, and taken out from among men, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward rightly called <hi>Zaphnath-paaneah,</hi> i.e.

<hi>chap.</hi> 12.47. Let us imitate our Lord; for even hereunto are we called: becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, <hi>leaving us an example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.21. <hi>Let us reſiſt unto blood, ſtriving againſt ſin, ſuffering in the fleſh, that we may ceaſe from ſin,</hi> Heb. 12.4. 1 Pet. 4 1. Ponder theſe things ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.
<note place="margin">6.</note>Sixthly,</p>
               <p n="22">22. We cannot underſtand nor ſubmit unto the Gospel, unleſs we know and conform unto the death of Chriſt. The ſum of the Gospel is Chriſt crucified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. There is a dolefull doom denounced againſt all thoſe that obey not this Gospel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.7,8,9,10. It is not enough for us to make
<pb facs="tcp:171778:12"/> our boaſt of the Gospel, except we obey it, no advantage comes by it; <hi>Not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, but he that doth the Will of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> Mat. 7.21. <hi>He that doth the Will, ſhall know the Doctrine,</hi> John 7.17. Now we muſt know, <hi>that every man is brutiſh in his knowledge, and born a wild Aſſes Colt,</hi> Jer. 10.14. Job 11.12. Pſalm 92.6. Wherefore it is neceſſary that every man take up his Croſs dayly, and crucifie this brutiſh man which is ſo ignorant of the Myſterie of God, and altogether uncapable to underſtand it, <hi>and put on the new man which is created after God in Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, and Knowledge,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. Eph. 4.22,23,24. Col. 3.9,10. The old muſt be put off before the new can be put on. Obedience is the beſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher unto knowledge.
<note place="margin">7.</note>Seventhly,</p>
               <p n="23">23. The grand Myſterie of iniquity worketh in the contrary Doctrine. When the Devil ſuſpected what ruine and deſolation was like to come upon his kingdom by the death of Chriſt, he did what poſſibly he could to ſave his life by <hi>Pilates</hi> wife. And ſo he is ſtill ſtirring ſome to be enemies to his Croſs, <hi>Phil</hi> 3.18. The old ſubtile Serpent argueth with us, as he did with our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Yea, ſaith he, doth God require ſuch ſtrictneſs and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect walking? doth he (think ye) delight to afflict his creature, the work of his hands? will he have thee die, mortifie and crucifie thy ſelf? Far be it from thee, <hi>Theſe things ſhall not happen unto thee,</hi> Mat. 16.22,23. Hath not Chriſt ſuffered for thy ſins? hath not he made full ſatisfaction, and done all for thee? Is there any thing left for thee to do? Canſt thou add to the vertue of his blood? Wilt thou fall back again to the Law, and be juſtified by the works thereof? Is not this flat Popery? Away, away with theſe legal and penſive thoughts, they make thee melancholy, dull and indiſpoſed to good things. Wilt thou ſeparate not only from the prophane Gentile, but from the outward and formal Jew alſo? Canſt thou by taking thought, add one Cubit to his ſtature? <hi>Were not the works finiſhed from the foundation of the world?</hi> Mat. 6.27. Heb. 4 3. <hi>Be not righteous overmuch, neither make thy ſelf over-wiſe; Why ſhouldeſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf?</hi> Eccleſ. 7.16.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Look upon the high and mighty profeſſors of the world; Are not the preud among them happy, and they that
<pb facs="tcp:171778:12"/> tempt God by Pride, Ambition, Covetouſneſs, Hypocriſie, Perjury, breach of Promiſes, Covenants, Vows, Oaths and Proteſtations, Rebellion, Domineering, are they not delivered, delivered to do all abominations? Doth not their Bull gender, and faileth not? have they not more then heart can wiſh, <hi>ſo that pride compaſſeth them about as a chain, and violence covereth them as a Garment?</hi> Mal. 3.15. Jer. 7.9,10,11.
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Job. 21.10. Pſalm 73.4,5,6,7. Take thine eaſe, eat, drink and be merry, to morrow ſhall be as this day. Thus the crafty Serpent inſinnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his damnable Doctrine, by his falſe Prophets, into the minds of ſimple, ignorant, preſumptuous Gospellers themſelves; Whereas the true Believer ſaith, <hi>It is his meat and drink to do the Will of his Lord and Maſter,</hi> (John 4.34.) <hi>To beat down his body, and bring it into ſubjection,</hi> 1 Cor 9.27. Nothing is more glory to him then ſuch tribulation; he takes pleaſure in ſuch neceſſity and diſtreſſes for Chriſts ſake, and is glad that he can die dayly, <hi>that the world may be crucified unto him, and he unto the world,</hi> Rom. 5.3. 2 Cor. 12.10. 1 Cor. 15.31. Gal. 6.14.
<note place="margin">8.</note>Eightly,</p>
               <p n="25">25. Without this knowledge and conformity there can be no perſeverance in Godlineſs. The Hypocrite will not pray always, he cannot; many begin to run well, but are driven back from obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth,
<hi>Gal.</hi> 5.7. They are clogd with the care of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the worldly life, they are full yet with their youthfull luſts, and the ſins of their riper years: Theſe youths ſhall faint, and ſuch young men utterly fail, becauſe they do not eat and drink the fleſh and blood of the Son of man, that they might have life and ſtrength to perſevere; they do not (by eating and drinking) incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the living bread and drink by a lively faith, that they might grow thereby, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.30, <hi>John</hi> 6.33.35,48,51. unto verſe 59. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. But the righteous ſhall hold on his way, and he that hath clean hands, that hath waſht them in innocency, in the innocent blood of the Lamb, <hi>he ſhall wax ſtronger and ſtronger; his light ſhall be as the ſhining light, which increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to a perfect day,</hi> Job 17.9. Prov. 10.29. and
<hi>chap.</hi> 4.18. <hi>But they that wait on the Lord, ſhall renew their ſtrength, and mount up with wings as Eagles,</hi> Pſalm. 103.5. Iſa.
40.31. The Eagle is ſharp of ſight, ſwift and lofty in flight, it can ſoar up, and look upon the Sun: <hi>So do all true Believers who have anointed their eyes with the ſpiritual eye-ſalve</hi> (Rev. 3.18.)
<pb facs="tcp:171778:13"/> 
                  <hi>which maketh them quick-ſighted; but then (like Eagles) they reſort unto the Carkaſs,</hi> Mat. 24.28. They have continual Recourſe unto the crucified body of Chriſt, refreſhing themſelves with that heavenly food, turning it into the nouriſhment of their inward and new man, and growing up therein unto a likeneſs and conformity unto that food. Theſe do not miſcarry, nor come ſhort of their aim.
<note place="margin">9.</note>Ninthly,</p>
               <p n="26">26. There can be no due performance of any acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto God without it. The Apoſtle exhorteth us, (<hi>Rom.</hi>
12.1.) <hi>to offer up our bodies a living ſacrifice, acceptable to God.</hi> For it is ſaid of <hi>Cain, That he offered unto the Lord of the fruit of the ground,</hi> Gen. 4.3. He brought an earthly, dead, liveleſs offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and was not accepted. <hi>But</hi> Abel <hi>brought of the fat of the flock.</hi> verſe 4. <hi>He offered the Firſtling of his fold, a pure, clean, lively ſacrifice, unto which God had reſpect; it was more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then his Brothers,</hi> Heb. 11.4. How came this to paſs? The Apoſtle tells us,
<hi>it was by faith.</hi> The life of faith is in death, and by death; that liveth when we are dead; <hi>I am cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Chriſt, yet I live, and I live in the fleſh by the faith of the Son of God,</hi> Gal. 2.20. He had a life in the fleſh after he was dead to the fleſh. Faith indeed ſhall ceaſe, but 'tis not till the end of the ſecond life. The principal act of faith is exerciſed in death, the death of Chriſt, and is a conforming vertue or power unto the likeneſs thereof by mortification and offering up of the fleſh with the affections and luſts unto death, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. God accepteth nothing but what is done in this faith, <hi>by this faith in the Son of God,</hi> John 15.5. Heb. 11.5.</p>
               <p n="27">27. We read in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.9. That <hi>Saul</hi> ſpared <hi>Agag</hi> the King, and the beſt of the ſpoil; but that which was vile, and refuſe, and good for nothing, that he and the people utterly daſtroyed. <hi>Saul</hi> was an hypocritical Tyrant, ambitiouſly aſpiring to a Kingdom, and got it: God gave a King in his anger. He that aimeth at the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not the beſt Saint.</p>
               <p n="28">28. <hi>Saul</hi> was a right Machiavilian, he knew the high way to the Crown.
<note place="margin">When <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> ſpake trembling he exalted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Iſrael, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.1.</note> When he was mean and low in a poor condition, and little in his own ſight, he could bow and cringe, flatter, fawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and comply with the vulgar, bemoan and pitty the burdens of the poor people, eſpecially the good people of the land; he could ſtand cap in hand to the meaneſt, and like <hi>Abſolom,</hi> court them
<pb facs="tcp:171778:13"/> into a good conceit of his Clemency and care of their well-fare, aſſuring them that if it were in his power to remedy it, things ſhould not be carried as they are; <hi>but firſt he put himſelf into a ſouldiers poſture,</hi> 2. Sam. 15.1,2,3,4,5. Now he rode poſt in the right rode to be the head of the Tribes of Iſrael, Commander in chief over the military Forces, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.17. yea God himſelf might ſo far have his work to do under his proud deſign, as to give him a Call to be King, and fight his battles, as is plain in the place cited, which might confirm him in a good opinion of himſelf to undertake the Government, eſpecially if ſome muſty Propheſies had been raked together, and by a Court-Paraſite particularly applyed to him: 'Tis as common for the higheſt as the meaneſt to be deluded, and miſtake or miſ-uſe many paſſages of Gods Providence. But now he is King, he grows covetous and ſelf-ended; he falls upon the ſpoil and the prey of the enemy, <hi>who ſeemed before to contemn all ſelf-intereſt and advantage,</hi> Sam. 15.19. His feigned and forged excuſe of reſerving it for Gods worſhip would not ſerve his turn. How faulty then are thoſe who do not ſo much as pretend any thing for Gods ſervice, but openly convert the common loſs into their private gain?

                  <hi>Brink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi> may not ſeem ſo pertinent and agreeable to the Subject in hand; yet I ſhall here inſert it, becauſe I know not whether ever I ſhall make uſe of the Preſs any more hereafter. My endeavour is to give you ſatisfaction concerning thoſe things about which there hath been ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreement in our Judgements; of which I ſhall give you my underſtanding and preſent apprehenſion very briefly.</opener>
               <p n="42">42. That there is a Preſcience and Previſion in the moſt Holy and only wiſe God, whereby he did and doth fore-know and fore-ſee from all Eternity all things that are, or ſhall be unto Eternity, this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not. But that there is ſuch an abſolute and peremptory Decree in God (either according to the Supralapſarian or Sublapſarian opinion) reprobating ſome men irrecoverably and unavoidably to Eternal damnation, hating them before they were, and neceſſtating them by vertue of ſuch a Decree to ſin after they had a Being, unto this I cannot conſent.</p>
               <p n="43">43. For if God had hated any thing before it was, be would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have given it a Being, as the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt Mercy upon all, for thou canſt do all things, and winkeſt at the ſins of men, becauſe they ſhould amend: for thou loveſt all the things that are, and abhorreſt nothing which thou haſt made; for never wouldſt thou have made any thing, if thou haſt hated it,</hi> Wiſd 11.23,24. Nor can I believe that there is any impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:171778:19"/> (as ſome ſay) in the Decree of God as a cauſe or an occaſion for man to ſin: For we muſt not ſay, that it is through the Lord that we fall away, or that he hath cauſed us to erre, for <hi>he hath no need of the ſinfull man,</hi> Eccl. 15.11,12.</p>
               <p n="44">44. Theſe two Texts of thoſe Wiſe men (though
<hi>Apocryphal</hi>) prevail more with me then the contrary aſſertions of all others whatſoever. And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> is poſitive and clear in this Truth: <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evils, neither tempteth he any man,</hi> Jam. 1.13. So that to affirm there is an inherent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercion in the Decree of God neceſſitating men unto or towards their final Ruine, is to impute a greater and more inevitable cauſe of mans deſtruction to God irreſiſtibly ſubjecting him thereunto, then to the Devil who can but tempt and entice him to ſin, having no power (at firſt) to force him to commit it. <hi>Again,</hi>

I have waited now about two years to give you ſatisfaction, and have ſolicited a private Diſcourſe, but could never yet obtain it.

For I ſtill affirm it as my belief, That <hi>Adam</hi> even in his innocency (and much leſs any man ſince his Delinquency) had no wiſdom, power, righteouſneſs, ability, holineſs, or any manner of good whatſoever of or from himſelf,

               <p n="49">49.

And this will plainly appear if we look back to the beginning: For God came to
<hi>Adam</hi> with the tender of the <hi>Seed</hi> before he knew his Wife, or had begoteen either Son or Daughter, and made the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to him generally, in terms at large, indefinitly and indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natively without limitation or reſtriction, not confining it to one, nor denying it to another.

               <p n="55">55. Again, The evidence of this Truth will be yet further clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, if we conſider how God expoſtulated the matter with
<hi>Cain:</hi> He doth not fall upon him with any hard ſpeeches, calling him Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, Caſt-away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but meekly reaſons it out with him,
<hi>Where is thy brother?</hi> If thou deſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? Whence we may conclude, that <hi>Cains</hi> murder did not proceed from any predeſtinate or impulſive Act of Reprobation, but from his own voluntary Inclination to the ſuggeſtion of Satan, by whom he was begotten a ſon of murder, in reſigning his Will to the Will of the wicked one,
<note place="margin">Iohn 8.44.</note>
                  <hi>who was a Murtherer from the beginning, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat Children of his own nature, like himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="56">56. Now if God had ſo irrecoverably reprobated
<hi>Cain</hi> from all Eternity, (as ſome ſay he did, and all other unrepenting wicked men as well as he) then there had been no place for acceptation of <hi>Cain,</hi> let him have done never ſo well; or elſe God ſhould make a ſhew of one thing, and intend the clean contrary, of which blaſphemous Imputation God forbid that any ſhould be guilty. But whereas God told <hi>Cain</hi> plainly, <hi>that if he had done well, he might have been accepted,</hi> it is manifeſt, that there was Grace enough given in the Promiſe as a publique ſtock, and laid up in <hi>Adam</hi> as a common perſon, in whom all Mankind then was, ſo that one as well as another might freely take of it, <hi>(for there is no Reſpect of perſons with God)</hi> to inrich, ſupply and enable himſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to do the Will of God.

               <p n="57">57. Nay <hi>Cain</hi> himſelf, when he was reproved by God, had not the impudence to anſwer or reply, that it was not ſo much his fault that he killed his brother, nor could he help or avoid what he did, for he was reprobated and rejected, left to himſelf, and denyed grace to withſtand the temptation, and reſiſt the Devil; No, he had no ſuch plea: for doubtleſs his Father and Mother did conceal the Promiſe no more from him (being the firſt born, and a man from the Lord, as his mother thought) then from <hi>Abel.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he takes ſhame to himſelf, laies his hand upon his mouth, bewails his condition, confeſſeth that his felly and ſin, (not Gods reprobating Act) had brought this miſery upon him; he doth not, he durſt not ſo much as once offer to open his mouth againſt God.

<hi>Pſalm</hi> 147.11. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.7.) diſtribute it ſelf unto the four ends of the earth?
<note place="margin">Pſalm 104.10,11.</note> And do not the Well ſprings of ſalvation, which run out of the hills of Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature and Attributes, deſcend and flow into the loweſt val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and meaneſt condition of humanity? May not all the wild Aſſes of the mountains, and all the beaſts of the field drink thereof? May not the fouls of Heaven make their habitation by them? May not unruly fools, truſting in their own mountain of folly &amp; ſtrength, be tamed: the brutiſh and beaſtly luxurious men in the field of this worldly nature have the heat of their fierce paſſions quenched, the high-ſoaring proud men in aery notions be brought down, and made to dwell with the meek and lowly Spirit of Chriſt? Let us not become Atheiſts, or rather Polytheiſts, making more Gods than one; which is done by dividing (and ſo deſtroying) the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the Will of the one only God. The doing of which we cannot avoid if we place two Wills in God,
<hi>viz.</hi> One ſecret, determining ſome men to deſtruction; and the other open, profeſſing, proteſting, ſwearing that he would net that any ſhould die.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith here, <hi>it drew nigh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mark</hi> expreſſeth it thus,<note place="margin">Mar.
14.1.</note> After two daies, ſaith he, was the Paſsover and unleavened bread. Which Feaſt was honoured with a double name. It was called the
<hi>Paſsover,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the offering of the Lamb, which in
<hi>Exodus</hi> is called <hi>the Lords Paſsover,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 12.11.</note> becauſe the deſtroying Angel that ſmote the firſt born of the Aegyptians did <hi>paſs over</hi> the Iſraelites houſes which were ſprinkled with the blood of the Lamb, and that ſame night brought them out of Aegypt. And it was alſo called the <hi>feaſt</hi> or <hi>daies of unleavened bread,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 12. &amp; 13. Lev. 23.6. Num. 28.17.</note> becauſe all the time of that feaſt (which laſted ſeven daies) the Jews were forbidden to eat leavened bread, or to have it in their houſes: and were commanded that they ſhould eat none but ſweet or unleavened bread. Now this Jewiſh ſolemnity began from the evening of the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth, and continued until the evening of the one and twentieth day.
<note place="margin">When the firſt moneth beginneth.</note>But the Jews did not begin the firſt moneth
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:171778:27"/> from the Calends of <hi>January,</hi> as the Romans do, but from the firſt new moon after the Spring-Equinox, which with us is in <hi>April.</hi> So that the feaſt of the Paſsover began at the evening of the fourteenth day of that moneth, which was the fift day of the week that year that Chriſt ſuffered. The next day, which we rightly call
<hi>Good-Friday,</hi> Chriſt was Crucified. And on that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day was a feaſt of the Jews, after which the Sabbath immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately followed, even another feaſt, yea a double feaſt. Whence <hi>John</hi> ſaith of it,<note place="margin">Joh. 19.31.</note> 
                  <hi>That day was an high day.</hi> Every Sabbath was very ſolemn of it ſelf: yea greater then all other feaſts. For the Jews might not ſo much as dreſs their meat on the Sabbath, which was lawful for them to do in other feaſts, though never ſo great, unleſs it fell on the Sabbath. Thus the Sabbath only had its preparation, that is, a day to make ready victuals. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, that Sabbath of which we now ſpeak was the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, in that it fell among the daies of unleavened bread, (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from ſome Phariſaical tradition, by reaſon of the rich booty they had from the multitude of people that then flocked thither from all parts.) From whence alſo it was called the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Paſsover, not that the feaſt of the Paſsover was on that day, but becauſe it fell out in the Paſsover-week: as we uſe to ſay now, the third, fourth, fifth day of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> Briefly; the Jews called every ſixt day the
<hi>preparation,</hi> though ſome feaſt fell thereon. So the Paſchal feaſt or ſolemnity happened on this ſixt day, which very day was alſo the preparation of the following Sabbath. It is certain therefore that Chriſt was crucified on the very feaſt day. Nor doth it prove the contrary, in that they ſaid,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Not on the feaſt day,</hi> &amp;c. For they regarded not the feaſt, but were rather afraid left the multitude ſhould hinder their wicked deſign. Therefore they did not ſay, Not on the feaſt day, <hi>becauſe it is not lawfull;</hi> but,
<hi>leſt there be an uproar among the people;</hi> nay they had not forborn their purpoſe the Sabbath following, though it was a <hi>great one,</hi> if there had not been ſome other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: ſuch was their rage. They might, as doubtleſs they did pretend, that God could not be better ſerved, or have a greater ſacrifice, then to crucifie ſo notorious a tranſgreſſor of his Law; And that in other offences they might and ought to defer or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the puniſhment: but Gods wrong they were to avenge on the very Sabbath it ſelf. To this was added the occaſion given
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:171778:27"/> by <hi>Iudas,</hi> who blinded with malice, reſolved to betray Chriſt to them, to be bound in the evening of the ſolemnity then begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
               <p>What ſhould they now do? They might well fear an uproar of the people if they ſhould keep him bound till the end of the feaſt. There is no way but to put their curſed plot in execution out of hand, without any reſpect to God, or the time. This was the counſel of an hateful heart. Yet not without the wonderful providence of God ſo ordering it, that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer at that feaſt: Not only that the truth might anſwer the figure, but alſo that many might be preſent when the high-Prieſt offered his blood to God without <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the redemption of Jew and Gentile. Thus much I thought good to premiſe concerning the day and feaſt of unleavened bread. Let us now return to the ſtory.</p>
               <p>The appointed time was come when the Lord Jeſus was both willing and ought to depart out of the world to go to his Father by ſuffering death, after he had prerched the Goſpel. And this was the very time when the Jews kept the Paſsover, and did offer and eat the Lamb in remembrance of their former deliverance. The time of the general redemption of mankind being now at hand, not from an Aegyptian, but deviliſh bondage, there was another Lamb to be ſlain, even be which taketh away the ſins of the world,<note place="margin">Joh. 1.29.</note> and of whom <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt our Paſsover is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed for us.</hi> Of this Chriſt ſaith;</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26.2.</note>
                  <hi>Ye know that after two daies is the feaſt of the Paſsover, and the Son of man is betrayed to be crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if he ſhould have ſaid, Seeing ye are born and bred Jews and Hebrews, ye know what kind of feaſt draweth nigh, even the feaſt of the Paſsover, and there is not a man in all the Countrey of <hi>Judea</hi> but makes preparation for it. But to ye that are my Diſciples, I will reveal ſomething that others know not; that is, that I the Son of man muſt be betrayed and crucified at this very feaſt; to wit, to be ſlain and offered as a Lamb on the Altar of the Croſs, for the welfare of the world. I ſay it muſt be at this feaſt of the Jews, as I have often told you long ſince. The time is at hand, my hour is now come, and I am ſo far from refuſing it, that I willingly embrace it: for therefore came I into the world, that I might ſhew my obedience to my Father, even to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:171778:28"/> the death of the Croſs. This ſhall now be done at this feaſt. I would not hide this from ye: Nor is there any cauſe for ye to be afraid. No man will, or can hurt you, though they be never ſo mad againſt me. For it is not your hour, but mine that is come. The Son of man ſhall be delivered.</p>
               <p>In theſe words Chriſt foretold both the day and manner of his death, that his Diſciples, when they ſaw it, might not fear and faint in their mind, as if ſome unexpected thing had come upon them.</p>
               <p>Obſerve, he doth not name the perſon: The Son of man ſhall be delivered; he doth not expreſs who ſhould deliver him, and that not without cauſe. For it was not one only that delivered him.</p>

<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16. Rom. 8.32.</note>Our heavenly Father, moved with mercy and love, deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for us.</p>

                  <hi>I reſtored that which I took not away.</hi> Chriſt puts us in mind of all theſe when he ſaith,

               <p>It is alſo to be noted that this word <hi>Paſsover</hi> is not taken from <hi>paſsion</hi> or ſuffering, as ſome think, but from the Hebrew word <hi>Phaſe,</hi> which ſignifieth a <hi>paſsing over,</hi> for the reaſon before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. And the ſame word <hi>Paſcha</hi> or Paſsover, is not alwaies
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:171778:28"/> taken in the ſame ſenſe. For ſometime it ſignifieth the Lamb to be offered, as when it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Mar. 14.12</note> Where wilt thou that we go and prepare, that thou maiſt eat the Paſsover. Sometime it ſignifieth the feaſt day, as,<note place="margin">Joh. 2.23.</note> When he was in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at the Paſsover. Sometime it ſignifieth all the Paſchal week, as,<note place="margin">Act.
12.4.</note> Intending after <hi>Eaſter</hi> to bring him forth to the people. Sometime it ſignifieth the unleavened bread, as where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Joh. 18.28.</note> They themſelves went not into the Judgement Hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled: but that they might eat the Paſsover.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26.3,4.</note>
                  <hi>Then aſſembled together the chief Prieſts, and the Scribes, and the Elders of the people, unto the Palace of the high Prieſt, who was called</hi> Caiaphas, <hi>and conſulted that they might take Jeſus by ſubtilty, and kill him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here the Evangeliſt diſcovereth what kind of men they were, who for envy could not endure to ſee or ſuffer the Lord Chriſt to live. He calleth them Prieſts, Scribes, and Elders of the people, as alſo Princes and principal men, from whom nothing leſs ſhould have been expected. For they were they that had the knowledge of the Law. To them the predictions of the Prophets were known. They, I ſay, were they whom one of them,
<hi>Nicodemus</hi> by name, perſonated, and ſaid,<note place="margin">Joh.
3.2.</note> 
                  <hi>Maſter we know that thou art a Teacher come from God: for no man can do theſe Miracles that thou doſt, except God be with him.</hi> Yet their envy ſo quelled all theſe things in them, that they chiefly, yea they alone were they that hunted Chriſt to the Croſs. Who can but wonder at ſuch groſs blindneſs of ſo many wiſe men? Yea who can but tremble at that terrible judgement of God, whereby he blinded them?
<note place="margin">Eſa. 6.10.</note>
                  <hi>that ſeeing, they might not ſee, and hearing they might not hear;</hi> yea that they ſhould both ſhut their eyes and ſtop their ears againſt a moſt clear truth?
<note place="margin">Obſervat.</note>Whence we may learn, that the free gifts of God do more hurt then good to them that believe not. Thus
<hi>knowledge</hi> without faith <hi>puffeth up:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervat.</note>Hence alſo we ſee that the wiſe and great men of this world are for the moſt part nothing but veſſels of Gods anger. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of the wiſe ones,
<hi>God gave them over to a reprobate ſenſe. Pharoah</hi> was therefore blinded, that God might ſhew his
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:171778:29"/> power in him. Boaſt not therefore of wiſdom or power, but fear. It is one of Gods greateſt works to
<note place="margin">Luke 1.51,52.</note>
                  <hi>ſcatter the proud in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of their hearts, and to put down the mighty from their ſeat.</hi> The Evangeliſt doth neatly pile up their ſin, malice and blindneſs, even in every word.</p>

<hi>Then,</hi> I ſay, when Chriſt had omitted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might make them happy. <hi>Then,</hi> when they had often ſeen the excellent doctrine and wonderful miracles of Chriſt: <hi>Then,</hi> I ſay, when he came with godly works to be prepared wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily to celebrate the feaſt of the Paſchal ſolemnity.

               </p>
               <p>And for what cauſe did they deſire to take and kill Ieſus, the true Saviour, who ſaved ſo many miſerable men in body and ſoul? Nothing is here expreſt. But it may be plainly collected out of
<hi>John,</hi> where when they conſulted, they ſaid,<note place="margin">John
11.47,48.</note> 
                  <hi>What do we? for this man doth many miracles. If we let him alone,</hi> &amp;c. But more fully out of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Wiſd. 2.12.</note> The wicked aſſembled againſt the righteous, ſaying, <hi>Let us lye in wait for him, becauſe he is clean contrary to our doings; he upbraideth us with our offending the Law, he was made to reprove our thoughts, he is grievous unto us, even to behold,</hi> &amp;c. You ſee what they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him, even the Light and Truth.
<note place="margin">John 3.20.</note>
                  <hi>Every one that doth evil hateth the Light.</hi> The Phariſees could not endure that their righteouſneſs ſhould be condemned, and they counted for ſinners. The Scribes could not bear it to be thought ignorant of the Law. As <hi>Abel</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> were hated of their own brethren for no other cauſe, but becauſe one was righteous, and accepted of God; and the other better beloved of his Father than the reſt; ſo happened it alſo unto Chriſt.</p>
               <p>No doubt but they made a fair pretence for this their hatred
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:171778:29"/> and malice, even a zeal for Gods Law, upon which ground <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded that the falſe Prophets ſhould be killed.<note place="margin">Deut. 13.5.</note> This they often charged Chriſt with before, but they neither did, nor could they prove it: yet, as if he had been already convicted of that crime, they reſolve to put him to death, becauſe they would be taken for ſuch as ſought Gods glory more then others. But O wicked Princes, ſeed of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and not of
<hi>Juda,</hi> What ſpirit taught ye to ſeek the glory of God by killing his only Son? For your conſultation is not againſt the Son of
<hi>Ieſeph,</hi> but againſt the Son of the great God. Your deſign was to take Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth</hi> by craft and to ſlay him: and it proſpered. But whom elſe have you taken and ſlain, but your own Meſſias, that true and great Prophet, the Saviour of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the King of glory, the Prince of life, and the beſt Shepherd whom God of his infinite mercy ſent to ye loſt ſheep? <hi>Iacob</hi> foreſaw this your counſel long ago, and hated it. <hi>Simeon,</hi> ſaith he,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.5.</note> 
                  <hi>and</hi> Levi <hi>have warlike wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of wickedneſs.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>It was the very Judgement of God, by which (as they well deſerved) they were long ſince given up to a reprobate ſenſe to do thoſe things againſt Chriſt which the hand and counſel of the Lord had determined. For they were <hi>veſſels of diſhonour.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>By the feaſt day, they meant that great Sabbath which fell out in the feaſt of the Paſsover: of this they would have great regard; not for the feaſt ſake it ſelf, but leſt there ſhould be an uproar among the people.

And they that durſt not eat leavened bread, although there was no cauſe why they ſhould abſtain from it, yet were not afraid to pollute the feaſt day, by committing murther on it. As were the Prieſts, ſuch was the people. But here is ſet down the nature of hypocrites, who indeed do many good things, but it is only that they may be ſeen of men: and they forbear to do evil, but no further then they are afraid to be puniſhed by men.

               <p>How happy are we Chriſtians, who have the benefit of the whole paſſion of Chriſt! For as that very bloody Council of the Phariſees fell out for our good, ſo is it for our advantage that that precious Oyntment was poured on the head of Chriſt. In the Council of the Jews there Chriſt had his enemies: on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary here are his friends and thoſe that miniſter unto him.

               </p>
               <p>Now concerning this Hiſtory, there hath alway been a great diſpute among the Antients, whether this anoynting be the ſame with that which <hi>John</hi> ſpeaketh of,<note place="margin">John 12.</note> or with that whereof <hi>Luke</hi> writeth.<note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> The general opinion is, that it is but one woman of which <hi>Matthew</hi> in

<hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> ſpeak:<note place="margin">Matth. 26. Mar.

<hi>Mary</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Lazarus. Faber, Stapulenſis</hi> would have them to be three, but doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe diſtinguiſh them.

<hi>Lazarus</hi> anoynted him but a little before his Paſſion. And he will needs have <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> to be that woman of <hi>Galilee</hi> out of whom Chriſt had before caſt out ſeven Devils, as it is <hi>Mar.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi> ſuppoſe the three <hi>Evangeliſts, Matthew, Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> do ſpeak of one woman, and <hi>Iohn</hi> of another. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> is doubtful, and can hardly reſolve the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:171778:31"/> and at laſt ſaith: Perhaps it was not one, leſt the <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts</hi> ſhould ſeem to claſh, <hi>&amp;c. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>ſuper. Lucam.</hi> Nor can it be eaſily determined by any unto this day. But certain it is, that <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> ſpoke of one and the ſame woman. And becauſe the anoynting which
<hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of, was alſo at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany,</hi> and in thoſe very dayes before the Paſsover, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately before Chriſts Paſſion, it is moſt like that he meaneth the ſame woman that the other two
<hi>Evangeliſts</hi> write of, whom alſo he calleth by her proper Name, which the other two do not.</p>
               <p>Whether this <hi>Mary</hi> of <hi>Bethany</hi> anoynted Chriſt twice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few dayes; Firſt, <hi>his feet,</hi> as <hi>Iohn</hi> faith, and <hi>then his head,</hi> as <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> report; and that there <hi>Iudas</hi> only, but here all the Apoſtles murmured together, let others judge. This is clear, that three of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> mean one and the ſame woman, whatever may be thought of that woman that was a ſinner. Certain alſo it is, that this Unction of Chriſt before his paſſion was at <hi>Bethany.</hi> For <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> name the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper, but <hi>John</hi> ſeems to intimate that it was in the houſe of <hi>Lazarus</hi> or <hi>Martha.</hi> To which we may anſwer, that either that <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper was the father of <hi>Lazarus</hi> and his ſiſters, or that <hi>Mary</hi> did anoynt Chriſt twice, both in her own houſe, and in the houſe of <hi>Simon</hi> the Leper: who was ſo call'd, not that he was a Leper at that time, but that he had been ſo, and was cleanſed by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>There is yet one ſcruple behind, in that <hi>Luke</hi> alſo ſaith,<note place="margin">Luke 7.</note> that Chriſt was anointed by a ſinner in <hi>Simons</hi> houſe, whence ſome may ſuppoſe that it was but one woman in all the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> though one may write more of her, and another leſs, as they do of other things. It is not ſo credible that there were two <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> in whoſe houſes Chriſt was twice anoynted. To this may be added, that <hi>Luke</hi> as well as <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that the woman wiped the feet of Jeſus with her hair, which argueth that it was one and the ſame woman. Nor doth that make againſt it, becauſe of the two <hi>Simons,</hi> one is called a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and the other a <hi>Leper;</hi> for the ſame man may be ſo called.</p>
               <p>Thus nothing can yet be here certainly determined: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paſſing by theſe things, let us come to the Hiſtory it ſelf.</p>
               <p>This woman is ſaid to bring an Alabaſter box of precious oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or according to <hi>Mark,</hi> of Spikenard very precious, or (as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:171778:31"/> 
                  <hi>John</hi> hath it) of Spikenard very coſtly. For it was, by conjecture, of <hi>Spikenard</hi> and
<hi>Balſam,</hi> which ſort of Oyl is accounted moſt precious, if it be not adulterated. But <hi>John</hi> ſaith expreſly, that this oyntment was
<hi>ex nardo piſtico,</hi> that is certain, and true, and not adulterated, ſo that the Diſciples valued it at 300. pence.</p>
               <p>Such kind of precious Oyntments were common among the richer ſort: The moſt precious was called the Royal Oyntment, which was made up of many precious things, as Spikenard, Gum of the Balm tree, Myrrhe Caſſia, Cinamon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And tis probable that this oynment of <hi>Mary</hi> was not much inferiour to it in value.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> agreeth hereto,<note place="margin">Lib. 13. cap.
1.</note>
                  <note place="margin">Lib. 12. cap. 12.</note> who writeth almoſt the ſame of the oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Spikenard, and addeth that the Spikenard of
<hi>Syriae</hi> is the beſt; and elſwhere he ſaith that ſuch kind of Oyntments are beſt kept in Alabaſters: Now Alabaſters are Glaſs-veſſels which Apothecaries commonly uſe.</p>
               <p>Let us now view the beauteous mind of this woman.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>When all were buſie in the houſe to wait on Chriſt a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Paſſion, (for they had provided him a Supper, at which <hi>Martha</hi> ſerved) <hi>Mary</hi> was not idle.<note place="margin">John 12.</note> So ought it to be in the Church; none ſhould be idle, but every one ſtrive ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his ſtrength to ſerve Chriſt, and contend who ſhould do moſt for him. Thoſe that are backward ſhould imitate thoſe that are forward. The ſtrong ſhould ſo much the more earneſtly preſs further, by how much the more eagerly others follow after them. O, happy houſe where things are ſo carried.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>See alſo with what boldneſs this woman cometh to Chriſt, whom even that holy man <hi>John</hi> was afraid to touch in <hi>Jordan:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> which confidence ſhe could no otherwayes attain to, but from the goodneſs of Chriſt, which ſhe had ſo often ſeen and tryed. It was not therefore raſhneſs in this woman, but ſtrong love, and exceeding great charity.<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> Thus Believers, though they be not yet quite free from ſin, dare boldly ſay to God: <hi>Our Father which are in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Again, This woman doth a good office to Chriſt, nothing terrified with the threats and curſed execrations of the
<hi>Phariſees,</hi> nothing at all troubled at the jeers and grumblings of others, only contented that Chriſt accepted her ſervice. Faith regards not the world, ſo it can but pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Beſides, She doth not bring any manner of Oyntment, but
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:171778:32"/> the beſt, that which was dear, and a great deal of it, even a whole <hi>pound,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> ſaith.<note place="margin">John 12.</note> Charity is of that condition, it knows no bounds: but the beſt whatſoever it hath, that it liberally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoweth on Chriſt. Nor doth it ſo much take notice what or how much it poureth out, but to whom, and for whom.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note>Moreover, She doth not anoint the feet of Chriſt only, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>John,</hi> but his head too, as
<hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> report, even ready to ſerve him in all things; and what ſhe commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly at firſt undertook, (if it were but one only woman every where) now ſhe doth more commendably accompliſh. At firſt ſhe anointed only his feet, now ſhe doth at once anoint both feet and head. So ſhould we aſcend from the feet of Chriſt to his head, that is, from his Humanity to his Divinity.</p>
               <p>But whereas it is ſaid, that ſhe anointed the head alſo of Chriſt, it is plain that it was no common Oyntment, (for ſuch would rather have beſmear'd him) but ſome pleaſant and ſweet-ſcented Liquor, or rich water, as hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">6.</note>Laſtly, She wiped the feet of Chriſt with her hair, as if ſhe had been drunk with love, not knowing which way to do him more ſervice, but willing to do more, if ſhe could. It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly ſaid, <hi>ſhe hath done what ſhe could.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 14.8.</note> Thus this woman indeed doth fill the whole houſe of God with the good ſmell of her pious work, whereby the Elect are yet refreſhed and ſtirred up to do the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>Chriſt yet holds his peace and lets her alone: yea he takes it in good part; not that he was taken with ſuch kind of pleaſures, nor that the thing was ſo much worth in it ſelf, but becauſe it proceeded from ſo great faith and devotion: for that is it which Chriſt moſt regardeth in our works.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Alſo Chriſt therefore ſuffered himſelf to be anoynted, becauſe that Unction prefigured his death and burial, as ſhall more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear hereafter.</p>
               <p>Although Chriſt behaved himſelf moſt lowly all his life time, yet would he honour death too, which he did not ſuffer by any neceſſity, but of his own accord, for the health of the whole world, and by which he would conquer the Devil. Hence it is that when he drew near his death, he was carried with trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant pomp into <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and hence alſo it was that he would be anoynted with coſtly oyntment before his death: and when
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:171778:32"/> he was dead would be buried in a new Tomb cut out of a Rock, and be wrapt in clean linnen by a Noble man.</p>
               <p>And therefore would he give more honour to his death than to his life, <hi>viz.</hi> for the comfort of his people, that they might know the death of the Saints is precious, even when their life is in glory: and that then they do moſt truly approach unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when they draw neereſt unto death.</p>
               <p>But this Unction of Chriſt doth in ſome ſort repreſent the Unction of his Father, wherewith he was anoynted to be a King and a Prieſt with the oyl of gladneſs above his fellows,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.7.</note> viz. with the holy Spirit, and the fulneſs of all grace, as it is <hi>Iſay</hi> 11.</p>
               <p>The hairs of Gods head (that is, the Elect) do wipe the drops of his Unction. <hi>Of the fulneſs of Chriſt do all receive.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 1.</note> The Saints are truly called the hairs of Gods Head. For as the hair in it ſelf is dead, yet ſticketh faſt to the head, and adorneth it: So the Saints in themſelves are dead. <hi>They mortifie their members upon earth, and die daily:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 3. 1 Cor.
15.</note> that is, they are alwayes ready to dye for Chriſt, yet they cleave cloſe to God as to their head; and in him they. This their Head they do alſo beautifie; for they glorifie God in word and work, and God is glorified in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>And from hence ariſeth a twofold comfort unto us, in that we know aſſuredly that this ſame Chriſt who was ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed of the Jews, was anoynted by God the Father, and that with the moſt precious Oyntment of all, the very ſmell whereof refreſheth the whole world. Again, becauſe we know that the drops of his Oyntment did, and yet do fall upon us.</p>
               <p>

<hi>Lazarus,</hi> by riſing out of, and flying from ſin. Secondly
<hi>Martha,</hi> alway exerciſed in good works. Thirdly <hi>Mary,</hi> anoynting Chriſt. The Oyntment wherewith Chriſt ſhould and would be anoynted is faith: yet not any kind of faith, but the beſt ſort,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Chriſtian faith. This faith muſt be made up of Spikenard: that is, it muſt be fervent, that ſo it may work by love: it muſt not be adulterate by mixture of Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours. It muſt be compleat, even a full pound, leſt it doubt in any one Article. We muſt anoynt both the head and feet of Chriſt, believing his Divinity and Humanity. Theſe things we ought to perform to Chriſt in his own Perſon; but yet we have not honoured whole Chriſt. For he hath a myſtical Body, the Church, in which he is Head; and all that Believe in him, are the feet.</p>
               <p>The Oyntment wherewith this body muſt be anoynted is
<hi>cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, out of a pure heart and faith unfeigned.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.5.</note> Anoynt then both head and feet, <hi>viz.</hi> love God, and thy neighbour. For charity from the heart is not enough, unleſs there be the hairs alſo, by which are ſignified outward riches, not only becauſe they do outwardly adorn, but becauſe they neither live, nor give life, nor deliver from death: Again, moſt commonly they are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, as the hair is; and as the hair may be cut off without pain, ſo ſhould we not be troubled to part with our world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods for the good of our Neighbour, ſeeing Chriſt beſtowed himſelf on us. Or thus, the hair is a kind of dead thing: ſo if thou haſt any dead thing in thee, as ſin, do as <hi>Daniel</hi> bids thee,
<hi>Break off thy ſins by righteouſneſs, and thy iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dan. 4.27.</note> In ſhort; this Oyntment ſignifieth that good ſavour of good works, which we that believe ought to beſtow on the Body of Chriſt, the holy Church, and members of Chriſt, after the example of that woman, from faith unfeigned, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that, <hi>In as much as ye have done it to one of theſe little ones, ye have done it unto me,</hi> Mat. 25.</p>

                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:171778:33"/> Thus not only <hi>Origen</hi> but
<hi>Auguſtine,</hi> refer that Unction to the good works of Believers, and it doth well agree. For as that houſe in <hi>Bethany</hi> was filled with the ſmell of the Oyntment,
<note place="margin">John 12. 2 Cor. 2.</note> ſo the good works of the Church, which is the true <hi>Bethany,</hi> ſend forth the ſavour of a good report among all Nations. Nor doth Chriſt himſelf interpret this unction otherwiſe; he calleth it <hi>a good work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Chriſtian then ought to do good works, and not ſpare for any coſt, ſo long as he may do any good to the members of Chriſt. He muſt not begrudge the Gold or Silver that is laid out on the Body of Chriſt.

<hi>Iudas</hi> only, that <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> ſpeak of the Apoſtles in general. And ſo it might be, that as well the other Apoſtles as <hi>Judas</hi> did murmur, but in a far diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent manner. The Diſciples might do it either out of ignorance or ſimplicity, ſuppoſing it was diſpleaſing to Chriſt, but know that he never uſed ſuch Delicacies. Nor did they doubt but that he would have been better pleaſed, if it had been all given to the poor. Therefore when they heard Chriſts anſwer, they were ſilent and well ſatisfied: But <hi>Judas</hi> was diſcontented upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, which yet he covereth with a very fair ſhew. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>He pretended as though he had been very zealous of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters honour: as if he ſhould have ſaid, Why do we trouble our good Lord with theſe trifles, ſeeing we know that he careth not for ſuch things?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>He pretended a great deal of zeal for the Reputation of the whole Colledge: as if he had ſaid, Such ſtate doth not become our Table: we profeſs poverty, following a poor Chriſt; pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty befits us more. What if men ſhould know of it? would it not be a ſcandal to them?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>But above all he made a ſhew, as if he had been very mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the poor; as if he had ſaid, if they were reſolved to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſo rich a Preſent, the Preſent might have been ſold, and the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:171778:34"/> price given to the poor, this had been a more religious act, and more honourable for our Maſter.</p>
               <p>O notorious hypocrite! how doth he cloke his covetouſneſs with a colour of conſcience for the poor? who would not have taken him for a very good and holy man? But <hi>John</hi> plucks off his mask, and ſhews his malice openly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">John 12.6.</note> 
                  <hi>This he ſaid, not that he cared for the poor, but becauſe he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here you have the reaſon why <hi>Judas</hi> had rather the Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould <hi>have been ſold for three hundred pence,</hi> even becauſe he would, and then could play the thief with them; for doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he might have done it very handſomly, becauſe <hi>he bare the bag.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Moſt truly was it ſaid of him, that he cared not for the poor; how ſhould he provide for the poor, who durſt deliver unto death the very mercies of the poor? His mind exceeded all bounds of humane pity; ſuch a ſtranger was he to godlineſs, that he deſtroyed godlineſs it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Again, Moſt truly and with much modeſty alſo is he called a thief. For <hi>Iohn</hi> might have ſet him forth in worſe colours. He was not ſimply a thief, but a ſacrilegious one.</p>
               <p>Now if ſecular Courts inflict more puniſhment on him that ſtealeth the publike Treaſure, than on him that robbeth but a private perſon, how much more abominable is ſacrilegious theft?</p>
               <p>And if he ſhall be ſorely puniſhed that ſteals but from his own maſter, how much more he that robbeth God?</p>
               <p>But <hi>Judas</hi> was unfaithful to his own Lord, and ſtole thoſe things which did belong to Chriſt and the poor; great ſacriledge.</p>
               <p>Thus in the entrance to the Paſſion, we ſee both the mercy and juſtice of God; his mercy in <hi>Mary</hi> that anoynted him, and his Judgement in <hi>Judas.</hi> That woman doubtleſs was a veſſel of mercy and grace for the comfort of Believers: but <hi>Judas</hi> was a veſſel of wrath for the terrour of all ungodly perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>And what you here ſee of the woman and <hi>Judas</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Paſſion,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 1.</note> the ſame may be ſeen in the end of the Paſſion concerning the two thieves. So that it is true which
<hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi> ſaith of the <hi>four living Creatures,</hi> that <hi>they had eyes before and behind.</hi> For what are the eyes of this living Creature with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:171778:34"/> 
                  <hi>four faces,</hi> but the reſpect of mercy and judgement? for both may be ſeen both before and behind, to wit, as well in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning as in the end of the Paſſion. Both theſe Chriſt would ſhew in his Paſſion: to let us know that it ſhould be to ruine, and reſurrection of many: to the ruine and condemnation of the wicked, but to the Reſurrection of the Godly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>In <hi>Judas</hi> may be ſeen an example of ſuch as do only perſonate Chriſtians, who have indeed a form of godlineſs, &amp; do many good works: but their heart is hardened with envy, ſtrife and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs; as <hi>Judas</hi> kept company with the Apoſtles, &amp; pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf a Diſciple of Chriſt, when in his heart he hated him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>In <hi>Judas</hi> is diſcovered the baſe nature of Hypocrites, who uſe to cloke their luſts with the name of God, as the Phariſees hid their envy againſt Chriſt under the ſafety of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, pretending the generall good of the whole Nation. So
<hi>Judas</hi> veiled his covetouſneſs under his care of the poor, whom he nothing at all regarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>As then there was a wicked
<hi>Judas</hi> among the Apoſtles, ſo will there ever be ſome like
<hi>Judas</hi> amongſt Chriſtians, <hi>viz.</hi> Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, of whom we have ſpoken already.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Such as clamour againſt the expences of others, crying, why was not this given to the poor? when they themſelves wickedly waſte their eſtates without doing the poor any good at all.</p>
               <p>They very much reſemble <hi>Judas</hi> who will needs provide for the poor; but for them only will they make proviſion, cenſuring any thing elſe that is otherwiſe laid out for the ſervice of God. Theſe condemn all men, conditions and works whatſoever that are not outwardly beneficiall to their neighbour, and altogether affirm that thoſe only are good works which are beſtowed on our neighbours. But this zeal is not according to knowledge. For we ſhould ſo love our neighbour, that we ſtill love God above him. Theſe are guilty of a double Errour.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe they would have us ſerve our Neighbour only, as though the three firſt Commandments ſtood for nothing. We know that Chriſt commanded us to love our neighbour, but we know alſo that the ſame Chriſt ſaid, This is the firſt and greateſt command, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. So he did not only ſay, give unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that are
<hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars,</hi> but he addeth, <hi>and to God the things that are Gods,</hi> Matth. 22.21.</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:171778:35"/> 2. They are miſtaken, in that they think our Neighbours do ſtand in need of outward help only; hence it is that they ſlight all ſpiritual good, wherewith their Neighbour ſhould be profit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Not only the hand, which getteth our living, is neceſſary to our Body, but the eye alſo, which though it doth not work, is otherwiſe profitable for the body. So they only that maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wife and children, do not ſerve their Neighbour, but they alſo, and they chiefly, which inſtruct them, pray for them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let no man therefore like <hi>Judas,</hi> condemn the practice or works of another, unleſs they be openly wicked, but let every man according to his calling ſtudy the welfare of the Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Above all, they are moſt like
<hi>Judas,</hi> who even now cheat the Lord of his eſtate, and pick Gods pockets, ſuch as embezle the goods of the Church, which were given to maintain the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and the poor: they that encroach thoſe goods, and right or wrong keep them to themſelves: heaping all they can poſſibly together, and ſpending it only in pomp and luxury, or to enrich their kindred; but God, the Church, or poor are never the better for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note>When prophane Princes ſee the ſacrilegious covetouſneſs of theſe men,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 50.</note> they preſently make havock of all. So that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is fulfill'd: <hi>When thou ſaweſt a thief thou wenteſt with him:</hi> none conſidering what follows in the ſame <hi>Pſalm, Theſe things haſt thou done, and I was ſilent.</hi> But I will reprove thee, and ſet them againſt thy face,

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">6.</note>There be more ſuch cut-purſes, who refuſe to pay their dues to the Church, as well as ſcrape the Church-goods baſely to themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">7.</note>They alſo are faulty that are Executors or Truſtees to diſpoſe the goods of the dead, which they bequeathed by Will, either to pay Debts, or reſtore that which was ill gotten, or to relieve the poor, yet do not according to their truſt, but convert all to their private gain. What elſe do theſe, but as
<hi>Judas</hi> did? This is ſo common now, that men make but a jeſt of it, and think it no ſin ſo to do.</p>
               <p>Hence we ſee, that there are very few that do not ſin in diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting their worldly goods. He that toucheth pitch ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed therewith.
<note place="margin">Eccl. 13. 1 Tim. 6.</note> And they that will be rich fall into many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and the ſnares of the Devil.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:171778:35"/> We ſee alſo that no man is a fit Miniſter of the Goſpel, whoſe mind is ſet on covetouſneſs. Laſtly, we ſee that covetouſneſs is the root of all evil: It made an Apoſtle become both a Thief and a Traytor.</p>
               <p>But leaving <hi>Judas</hi> and his companions, let us return to the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. Ye have heard the pious deed of the woman: ye have heard alſo the diſcontent of the Diſciples. What doth the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man do now? She doth not go about to excuſe her ſelf, but is ſatisfied with the teſtimony of her own conſcience, which ſhe was ſure was well known to Chriſt. Our boaſting and excuſe ſhould be the teſtimony of a good conſcience, 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>But on the contrary Chriſt defendeth her. For he is not only the Judge, but the Advocate alſo of his people, and defendeth them not only againſt the reproach of the world and the Devil, but before the Judgement of God too.
<note place="margin">1 John 2.</note> 
                  <hi>We have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> Hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks ſo confidently: <hi>it is Chriſt that dyed, who alſo roſe again, he intercedeth for us; Who ſhall accuſe Gods Elect?</hi> The Accuſer can do thee no hurt, if thou and thy works be approved of God.</p>
               <p>Now Chriſt anſwereth partly in the ſingular number, becauſe of <hi>Judas,</hi> and partly in the plural number, becauſe of the reſt of the Apoſtles, to theſe he ſpeaks mildly and gently, but to
<hi>Judas</hi> he replyeth very roughly.</p>

               <p>This was ſpoken to <hi>Judas,</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid: I know I am an eye-ſore to thee, and that thou canſt not endure me; ſtay a little, and not only my preſence, but my grace too, ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of thy ſight. She hath not loſt her labour in pouring out her Oyntment upon me, nor did I ſuffer it without a cauſe: it foreſheweth and ſignifieth a great thing, to wit, that I muſt ſhortly die and be buried for a ſweet ſavour of all the Elect. For the bodies of the dead are wont to be anoynted: What therefore ſhe cannot do to me when I am dead, that ſhe doth now beforehand, though ſhe doth not know it: therefore let her alone.

But he that doth at this time do good to the poor, doth not thereby openly confeſs me: but he that doth to me as this woman doth: for by this deed ſhe openly witneſſeth her faith in me, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any fear at all.</p>
               <p>Here then we learn how to confeſs Chriſt. For in times of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:171778:37"/> perſecution it is not enough to ſhew pitty to the poor, but we ought alſo to make open confeſſion of the faith of Chriſt; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we deny Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Luke 9.</note> according to that, <hi>He that is aſhamed of me before men, of him will I be aſhamed before God.</hi> So in times of hereſie and ſchiſm, tis not ſufficient to keep the true Faith in our heart, but we ought to make confeſſion of it too.</p>
               <p>But whereas Chriſt ſaith, <hi>me ye ſhall not have alwayes,</hi> it is not ſo to be underſtood, as if Chriſt were not now in the world, or as though he were with us in ſpirit, and according to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, and not alſo preſent with his Body, eſpecially at the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. But he ſaith, he would not be alwayes in the world, ſo as he was then with <hi>Mary, viz.</hi> viſible and tangible, paſſible and mortal. Ye ſhall not alwayes, ſaith he, have me as I am now with this woman, or as the poor are with ye, who may be the better for your worldly goods. Thus are we to underſtand that which he ſaid after his Reſurrection. <hi>Theſe are the words which I ſpake when I was with you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> &amp;c. Yet then when he was with them bodily, it was not as formerly, to wit, mortal and paſſible.</p>
               <p>Thus the Body of Chriſt is not viſibly, ſenſibly, and paſſibly in the Sacrament, yet we acknowledge that the body of Chriſt is there;
<note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> as it is written, <hi>Take and eat, this is my Body.</hi> Nor is it a good conſequence to ſay, the Body of Chriſt is not ſome way, that is, viſibly in the Sacrament, therefore it is not there at all. As it doth not follow to ſay, The King doth not ſit at Table Crowned, therefore he doth not ſit at Table. There is a fallacy in it, concluding ſimply from that which is ſpoken but after a ſort.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 14.8.</note> 
                  <hi>She hath done what ſhe could, ſhe is come aforehand to anoynt my Body to the burying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As if he had ſaid, ye might have gueſſed from the very anoynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I muſt ſhortly be buryed; and if I muſt be buryed, I muſt firſt die. Therefore Chriſt doth again commend this deed of the woman, becauſe thereby he would thorowly inſtruct all to be zealous to maintain good works. This fact hath a fourfold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>Becauſe it proceeded from great Devotion and Love.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>It was a manifeſt confeſſion of that womans faith which ſhe had in Chriſt, and therefore was greater than if ſhe had given all her goods to the poor. He that giveth to the poor, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:171778:37"/> a good work, and thereby acknowledgeth God, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hazard; either by private, or publike, and general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. So to confeſs is praiſe worthy, but tis without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. But this woman by this her deed expoſed both her ſelf and hers to greateſt danger. This indeed is true and free confeſſion. This is to forſake and hazard all things for Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>It was therefore a commendable act, becauſe it did foreſhew Chriſts buriall; as the Ceremonies of the Old Teſtament were pleaſing to God, not as they were works, nor as they were coſtly works, but becauſe they ſhadowed forth Chriſt, and became good works as they were done by faith in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Laſtly, If for nothing elſe, yet for this one thing did this womans work deſerve to be commended, in that it did ſhew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand how that the whole Church was to be fill'd with the fragrancy of Chriſts death, and the odour of the Goſpel. As alſo in that it foreſhewed what manner of perſons all Believers ſhould be towards Chriſt to the worlds end.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 14.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, whereſoever this Goſpel ſhall be preached throughout the whole world, this alſo that ſhe hath done, ſhall be ſpoken of for a memorial of her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaith his Paſsion is the Goſpel, and it is truly the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; that is, it is a good Meſſage. For what better news can we hear of, than that the Son of God hath taken away our ſins by his own death. Therefore (ſaith Chriſt) whereſover my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ſhall be preached, this woman and her faith alſo ſhall be admired. For from them all Believers ſhall have a Preſident of faith and charity. Of faith, that they may know how to anoynt both the head and feet of Chriſt, <hi>i. e.</hi> to acknowledge him both God and man, not daunted with death or danger. Of Charity, that they may learn to anoynt Chriſts feet with Oyntment, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſuccour their Neighbour with works of mercy, and to wipe their feet with their hair, that is, ſo to ſupply the wants of the needy with the abundance of their riches, without impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves, as they pole themſelves without pain.</p>
               <p>Here we ſee how an immortal name may be gotten, to wit, by godlineſs and good works. For as wicked men die with a noiſe only, and leave nothing but a naſty name behind them; ſo the Righteous are in everlaſting Remembrance. Some there be (ſaith the wiſe man) which have no memorial,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 44.9.</note> who are periſhed as
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:171778:38"/> though they had never been, and are become as though they had never been born. But the name of mercifull men abideth from generation to generation. Thus this woman by one good deed got her both a perpetual and precious name, which ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be blotted out. For as long as the Goſpel laſteth, ſo long the praiſe and memory of this woman ſhall endure.</p>
               <p>If thou therefore wouldſt have a perpetual name and memory, ſtrive to imitate this <hi>Mary</hi> in good works, who as ſhe is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in <hi>Luke</hi> for hearing the word of God,
<note place="margin">Luke 10.39.</note> ſo here ſhe is praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her care of good works. Do thou therefore joyn both together, a love of Gods Word, and a zeal of good works. Thus much of this Hiſtory: it follows in the Text:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.3,4.</note> 
                  <hi>Then entred Satan into</hi> Judas <hi>ſurnamed</hi> Iſcariot, <hi>being of the number of the twelve: and he went his way, and communed with the chief Prieſts and Captains.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26.15.</note> 
                  <hi>And ſaid unto them, what will ye give me? and I will deliver him unto you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> would deſcribe the perſon of the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, he doth fitly premiſe, that Satan entred into him; otherwiſe it had been moſt ſtrange that any man could be ſo wicked, and act ſo villanouſly and cruelly againſt his Lord. But becauſe we hear that Satan entred into this man, it is the leſs to be admired that he ſhould dare do ſo horrid a thing: for where that moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable gueſt is, there no good can be expected. As the Holy Spirit ſtirs them up, in whom he dwelleth, to all good: ſo that wicked ſpirit ſpurs them on to all evil. Where we ſee,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>That the Devil was the cauſe of Chriſts death and ſuffering: firſt by this Traytor: then by the hands of ſinners, as the Jews and Gentiles. Whence he is rightly called Satan, or Chriſts Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>We ſee how dangerous it is once to give place to the Devil, for he will never leave haunting us, when once he findeth that our faith is feeble, and that our unſtable heart is intangled with ſtrange cares: as we ſee here in <hi>Judas,</hi> who becauſe he firſt yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Devil when he tempted him to covetouſneſs, he is now wholly poſſeſt by him.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> do exactly deſcribe the perſon of this Traytor, as well by his name as his office, that the greatneſs of his ſin may the more appear. His proper name was
<hi>Judas,</hi> his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:171778:38"/> furname was <hi>Iſcariot;</hi> which the Evangeliſt did carefully add, to diſtinguiſh him from <hi>Judas</hi> the brother of <hi>James,</hi> who is called both <hi>Thaddaeus</hi> and
<hi>Lebbaeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was called <hi>Iſcariot,</hi> either from the Tribe whence he came, <hi>viz. Iſachar:</hi> or as ſome think, from a little Village where he was born. Some are of opinion, that the Evangeliſts did therefore add this ſurname of his, to ſhew that he was born for this villany. For
<hi>Iſachar,</hi> whence <hi>Iſcariot</hi> ſeems to be derived, ſignifieth <hi>Reward</hi> or <hi>Wages.</hi> Others think, that
<hi>Iſcariot</hi> is derived from <hi>Iſh,</hi> which ſignifieth a
<hi>Man;</hi>

                  </note> and <hi>Carath,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>to beat down, to deſtroy, to root out, &amp;c.</hi> So that <hi>Iſcariot</hi> is as much as to to ſay, <hi>a ſlaughter-man:</hi> which name doth too well ſute to this man, for indeed he ſhewed himſelf to be ſuch a one. He had alſo another name, to wit, <hi>Simon,</hi> as appears by <hi>John;</hi> for ſaith he, he gave the ſop to <hi>Judas Iſcariot,</hi> the ſon of
<hi>Simon.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 13.26.</note> Theſe three names fully ſet forth the condition of this man, ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravating alſo his ſin, and are a Picture of all falſe Chriſtians.
<note place="margin">1.</note>For firſt he was <hi>Simon,</hi> in that he heard the Goſpel of Chriſt: (for <hi>Simon</hi> ſignifieth
<hi>Hearing.</hi>)
<note place="margin">2.</note>He was alſo <hi>Judas,</hi> in that he profeſt himſelf a Diſciple of Chriſt; (for <hi>Judas</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Confeſsing</hi>)
<note place="margin">3.</note>but indeed, and in truth, he was
<hi>Iſcariot, i. e.</hi> a Murtherer. Thus falſe Chriſtians hear the Goſpel, and profeſs Chriſt, but in their practice deny him:
<note place="margin">Tit. 1.</note> and ſo are like the Traitor
<hi>Judas.</hi> It will not ſerve the turn, to hear and make Confeſſion, if thou play <hi>Judas</hi> in thy practice.</p>
               <p>So much for the Traitors name: now conſider his office. It is ſaid, that he was one of the twelve Apoſtles, whom Chriſt had choſen out of all the world for his intimate friends, to whom he ſhewed all his Secrets.
<note place="margin">1.</note>This by others was counted a great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to be one of Chriſts Apoſtles. But 'twas little praiſe to this man, it was rather his utter tiſgrace: for his malice ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo much the more abominable, in that he was an Apoſtle of Chriſt. Who can but tremble to hear that the Devil entered into an Apoſtle? If that wicked one durſt ſet upon the Apoſtles, nay if he could hurry one of them into horrid baſeneſs, which of us can be ſafe? Wherefore <hi>Pauls</hi> admonition is not in vain,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 1 Pet. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>That he that ſtandeth ſhould take heed leſt he fall.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth, <hi>Be ſober and watch, knowing that your Adverſary the Devil goeth about like a roaring Lion, ſeeking whom he way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Again, Who can but tremble to think, that in ſo ſmall and ſo holy a company, ſo vile a wretch ſhould be found?

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Beſides, If there were ſo bad a fellow in that little Colledge, which Chriſt himſelf founded: no marvail if there be many unworthy men in the great Colledges of mens building. Let every man beware that he be not in his Fellowſhip or Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, as
<hi>Judas</hi> was among the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Laſtly, Is it not ſtrange, that Chriſt ſhould be betrayed by one of thoſe that came with him, and was honorably entertained at <hi>Bethany,</hi> and ſate at Table with him? This is that which the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> complaineth of:
<note place="margin">Pſalm 55.</note> 
                  <hi>It was thou, a man, mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance. We took ſweet council together, and walked unto the houſe of God in company, &amp;c.</hi> Though it ſound ſomewhat harſh, that wicked men ſhould be in Chriſts company: yet 'tis more pleaſant to hear that there was but one bad man there. And the praiſe of the other Apoſtles is ſo much the more, in that they had ſo naughty a fellow among them, yet none of them was ſeduced by him. For no doubt, but he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſet them againſt Chriſt. On the other ſide, the condemnation of <hi>Judas</hi> was ſo much the heavier, in that he lived among godly men, and was never the better. That odour of the Oyntment which refreſhed the reſt, was the ſavour of death unto death unto him; yea, becauſe he was already dead and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed in his ſins, he could not endure the ſavour of life. Well then, what doth he? He takes his courſe, and wholly forſakes the Apoſtles. He departs from God, and ſideth with the Devil, quits the Apoſtleſhip,
<note place="margin">Acts 1. Pſalm 1.</note> and leaveth his Biſhoprick to another. <hi>He went over to the council of the ungodly, he ſtood in the way of ſinners, and ſat down in the ſeat of ſcorners.</hi> He went to the chief Prieſts, whom he knew certainly that they had reſolvedly conſpired the death of Chriſt Jeſus, and that nothing would hinder the execution, if they could but apprehend him without diſturbance.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:171778:39"/> Which to do, none was more ſit than one of Chriſts familiar companions, who well knew where Chriſt was wont to retire himſelf. And one there was among them, who loved baſe lucre above a bountifull Lord. So pernitious a thing is covetouſneſs, if it once get into the heart.</p>
               <p>Thus this baſe fellow runs from the Apoſtles to the Prieſts, thoſe enemies of Chriſt, and back again from them to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; this notorious Hypocrite thereby endeavouring to cover his wickedneſs, converſing all the while with the Apoſtles under pretence of Piety. Thoſe that would be accounted Chriſtians, counterfeit their form and porofeſſion, though they ſtill be in league with the enemies of Chriſt, theſe are diſſembling Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites. This wretch was not content to caſt off his Maſter, and curry favour with his enemies, but he muſt treacherouſly betray him into their hands; <hi>What will ye give me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I will deliver him unto you?</hi> This he ſaid of his own accord, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inticing Promiſes, but ſpitefully and maliciouſly againſt Chriſt. As if he had ſaid, I underſtand you have a deſign to put Jeſus to death, I ſhall be ready to aſſiſt you therein; I am one of his privy Council, I know his ſecrets and retirings; I can cloſely convey him to you without any ſtir or tumult, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where obſerve the malice of this wicked man, and his noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious contempt of Chriſt; Firſt, In that he came before he was ſent for. Secondly, In that he diſdains to call Chriſt <hi>Maſter,</hi> but only ſaith, I will dever <hi>him</hi> unto you. Thirdly, In that he left the price to their pleaſures as one ready to betray Chriſt for a ſmall matter. See what covetouſneſs will do! Surely it is <hi>the root of all evil.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.</note> Well may we cry out upon this wretched man that was ſo careleſs of his own happineſs: O miſerable wretch, what haſt thou ſaid? What is thy plot? Doſt thou ſo love and hunt after money? What Doctrine didſt thou preach to others when Chriſt ſent thee forth? Doſt thou love Gold better then Jeſus? If all
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the wealth therein had been offered thee, oughteſt thou to have done this villany againſt Chriſt, againſt thy Lord and Saviour? But envy and covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will ſo blind a man, that for a little revenge or gain, he cares not to ſin againſt God himſelf. It follows.</p>

And we ſhall hear anon, that the Elders of the people, who were to adminiſter Juſtice, did not condemn him to death.

                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 31.11.</note> which did now plainly appear to be true. For none did more baſely account of Chriſt, and more vilifie him to others, than thoſe that repreſented him on earth. None more corrupt, than thoſe that ſhould do juſtice. None more pervert the Word of God and the Goſpel, then thoſe that moſt glory of it; who boaſt that they are <hi>Judas,</hi> that is, true confeſſors of the name of God, but are indeed <hi>Iſcariots,</hi> that is, ſuch as will do any thing for gain. In a word, None more blaſpheme Chriſt, than ticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Chriſtians. Let us not then be ſo angry with <hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſeeing we do the ſame our ſelves, and worſe. They tore his body, but kept his coat whole. But we rend and tear every member of Chriſt, and break the unity of the faith and of the Church with croſs peeviſhneſs. Briefly, We who do now ſo vilely eſteem the Word of God, the name of Chriſt, Righteouſneſs, and the members of Chriſt, even we would have killed Chriſt, as well as the <hi>Jews.</hi> This was the Evangeliſts opinion when they ſo exactly deſcribed <hi>Judas,</hi> who ſold him, and the
<hi>Jews</hi> that bought him.</p>
               <p>Obſerve this too; Never any of the Saints was ſo ſold and ſo bought as Chriſt was, <hi>viz.</hi> bought and ſold to be ſlain.
<hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> indeed was bought and ſold, but not unto death, but bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage. Chriſt only was ſold and bought to die, and that at a low rate: which by the righteous Judgement of God fell out to the great loſs both of ſeller and buyers. For inſtead of thoſe thirty pieces of ſilver,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 109.</note> they got thirty moſt terrible maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which <hi>David</hi> fore-ſaw would come upon them: As 1. Set thou a wicked man over him. 2. Let Satan ſtand at his right hand.
3. When he ſhall be judged, let him be condemned. 4. Let his prayer become ſin. 5. Let his days be few. 6. Let another take his office. 7. Let his Children be fatherleſs. 8. And his wife a Widdow. 9. Let his Children be continually Vagabonds, and beg. 10. Let them ſeek their bread out of their deſolate places. 11. Let the Extortioner catch all that he hath. 12. Let ſtrangers ſpoil his labour. 13. Let there be none to extend mercy unto him.
14. Let there be none to favour his fatherleſs children. 15. Let his poſterity be cut off. 16. In the generation following, let their name be blotted out. 17. Let the iniquity of his fathers
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:171778:41"/> be remembred with the Lord. 18. Let not the ſin of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be blotted out. 19 Let them be before the Lord conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. 20. That he may cut off the memory of them from the earth. 21. He loved curſing, ſo let it come unto him. 22. As he delighted not in bleſſing, ſo let it be far from him. 23. He cloathed himſelf with curſing, like as with his garment. 24. Let it come into his bowels like water. 25. And like oyl into his bones. 26. Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him. 27. And for a girdle, wherewith he is girded continually.
28. When they ariſe, let them be aſhamed. 29. Let mine Adverſaries be cloathed with ſhame. 30. Let them cover themſelves with their own confuſion, as with a Mantle.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the thirty pieces of ſilver for which
<hi>Judas</hi> ſold Chriſt. See now how wickedly, how damnably he recovered the loſs of the oyntment. The wretched man thought that he ſhould have had the thirty pieces of ſilver, but he got nothing but thirty curſes, which ſtuck cloſe to him, after he had thrown the money from him in the Temple. He did not as yet feel the weight of thoſe curſes, but not long after he was ſenſible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; when he hanged himſelf in deſpair.
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.</note>Nor did he go away alone with theſe Maledictions, but the Jews alſo had their ſhare with him; and ſo ſhall all they, who for gain ſhed blood, or commit any other ſin againſt God, or their Neighbour.

                  <hi>Now the firſt day of the Feaſt of unleavened bread, when the Paſsover muſt be killed, the Diſciples came to Jeſus, ſaying, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the Paſsover?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Enough hath been ſaid of the damned Traytor already. Now the Evangeliſts are about to deſcribe that moſt ſacred Supper, which was the laſt at which Chriſt was with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples.</p>
               <p>There is ſcarce any thing that the Evangeliſts do more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſet down: and that juſtly too. For there was nothing ſaid or done at that Supper, but was worth the noting.</p>
               <p>Now there muſt be ſome reaſon, as alſo time and place for that Supper. Of all which the Evangeliſts omit nothing.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:171778:41"/> The dayes of unleavened bread were the time of this Supper. The place was a large upper room, well furniſhed. The occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was the Paſchal Lamb, which the Jews did then eat accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtom.</p>
               <p>Why thoſe were called the days of unleavened bread, I have told you in the entrance of this diſcourſe. 'Tis needleſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it now, ſeeing the word it ſelf explains it. For <hi>Azymus</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from <hi>A,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>without;</hi> and <hi>Zyma</hi> which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Leaven:</hi> as much as to ſay, without leaven, unleavened bread.
<note place="margin">Levit. 7.</note> For in thoſe days the
<hi>Jews</hi> might not eat leavened bread, nor offer ſuch bread, no, nor ſo much as have it in their houſes:
<note place="margin">Luke 13.</note> A figure, that no Hypocriſie, or any Phariſaical thing ſhould be found in the Church. Thus Chriſt expoundeth Leaven, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware</hi> ſaith he <hi>of the leaven of the Phariſees, which is Hypocriſie.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> Let us keep the feaſt</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, not with old leaven, but with the unleavened bread of ſincerity and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The feaſt of the Paſsover drawing nigh, the Diſciples took care about the Paſchal Lamb; for they were Jews,
<note place="margin">Exod 12.</note> and knew the cuſtom of the Nation, and the Command of the Law. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they did not delay till the time was come to eat it, or till Chriſt put them in mind of it, but thought on't before hand of their own accord. So that tis evident, they had a great care that the Command of God ſhould not be neglected, leſt it ſhould be imputed to them as a great ſin, if they kept not the Paſsover. Therefore all buſineſs laid aſide, they mind this only. <hi>Where wilt thou,</hi> ſay they, <hi>that we prepare for thee? &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus Chriſtians ſhould be carefull to obſerve all good old and godly cuſtomes, and by no means ſleight them. For there will ſome good fruit come of it, when the Church of Believers do unaminouſly go on in that which is good.</p>
               <p>See here the Diſciples willingneſs: like devout men they are mindfull of the legal inſtitution, and like humble ſervants, they tender their duty and ſervice unto Chriſt:
<note place="margin">The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 
                  <hi>Where ſhall we make ready? &amp;c.</hi> as if they had ſaid, It becometh us to know thy pleaſure; it is our duty to ſerve and make all ready for thee our Maſter. We know thou wilt not omit or neglect this legal Ceremony: but where thou intendeſt to celebrate it, we know not.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>He ſendeth two of his Diſciples, but ſpecially <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> as <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith; that is, the chiefeſt of all the Diſciples, which is not without a Myſterie.
<note place="margin">John 21. John 20. Acts 3.

When the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt was given, they went up together into the Temple. At the Supper twas <hi>Peter,</hi> not the other Dſciples, that beckoned to
<hi>John</hi> to ask who ſhould betray their Lord? Theſe two alſo left moſt excellent Epiſtles behind them, <hi>viz.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> &amp; 1
<hi>John:</hi> in which they did, and ſtill do teach great Myſteries;
<hi>Peter</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Chriſt is the <hi>Rock. John</hi> teacheth that he is the <hi>Grace</hi> of God: both of them according to their Name.
<hi>Peter</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying a Rock; <hi>Iohn</hi> the Grace of God.</p>
               <p>Theſe two then are ſent to make ready the Paſsover: but for whom? even for Chriſt; yet not for him only, but for his Church too. Which they did with all induſtry. For who but the Apoſtles framed and prepared for us the Communion-table and Altar of the Church? <hi>viz.</hi> by their preaching and writings?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>But obſerve: they do not this without command from their Lord. For unleſs the Lord call and ſend forth Teachers,

<note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> Otherwiſe when he was at
<hi>Bethany,</hi> he could not have ſo well known that not a maid, but man-ſervant ſhould meet his Diſciples with a pitcher of water; much leſs could he know whether he was going, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By this therefore he would ſhew his Godhead, as he did another time when he ſaid to his Diſciples,

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">8.</note>Again, He doth not ſend word to the good man of the houſe by way of intreaty, but as it were commandingly, that he would keep the Paſsover at his Houſe: as when he ſent his Diſciples for the Aſs,

               <p>Whereby he would ſhew that he was Lord of all, and could if he pleaſed command all.</p>
               <p>No doubt but he to whom he ſent his Diſciples was a very godly man, and perhaps a Diſciple of Jeſus, as <hi>Nicedemus</hi> and

                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:171778:43"/> That Chriſt foreknew all things to come, may be ſeen, in that after he had commanded his Diſciples, he aſſured them of the good mans readineſs; <hi>He ſhall ſhew you,</hi> ſaith he,

               <p>A good Chriſtians houſe is a kind of Church and Hoſpitall for the poor. For there he readeth:
<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> there he prayeth the Father in ſecret: there he teacheth his children and family the things per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to godlineſs: there alſo be receiveth and refreſheth the poor. Did not this Houſe-keeper do thus? His houſe was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Church, wherein Chriſt inſtituted the Sacrament of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and where he both did and taught ſuch Heavenly things. Laſtly, where the Diſciples afterward received the Holy Ghoſt. And was not his houſe an Hoſpitall, where Chriſt and his poor ſchool were ſo charitably refreſhed? To ſuch like uſes, that man whoſoever he was, ſet apart his houſe. A notable example in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, but very rare. Our houſes do not entertain the poor, but drabs and bawds,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the Diſciples found as Jeſus had told them before; he
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:171778:44"/> failed them in nothing. Who then would not believe Chriſt in every thing elſe? Who can now doubt of his Divinity? Shall we look for ſtronger arguments?
<note place="margin">The myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> The myſtical ſence may be this; When the Diſciples were ſent into the world to prepare the true Paſsover, firſt there met them a man bearing a pitcher of water, that is, the Jewiſh people too much oppreſt under the burden of the Law, which in compariſon of the Goſpel hath no more taſte or reliſh than water, which doth rather oppreſs than comfort the ſtomach. Now when this water, to wit, the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſet aſide, the Apoſtles made ready the true Paſsover by the preaching of the Goſpel; not among the <hi>Jews</hi> who rejected it, but with the Gentiles, whoſe houſes that were formerly prophane, are now become Churches. This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to the <hi>Jews, It was neceſſary that the Word of God ſhould firſt have been ſpoken unto you:
<note place="margin">Acts 13.</note> but ſeeing ye put it from you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>What things were requiſite to the preparation and eating of the Paſsover, may be found at large in <hi>Exodus.</hi> Firſt, there muſt be a Lamb.
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> Then the poſts were to be ſprinkled with the blood of the Lamb. Thirdly, the Lamb muſt be roaſted. Alſo it was to be eaten with bitter herbs and unleavened bread: beſides they were to have ſhooes and ſtaves. When you hear that the Diſciples made ready the Paſsover, ſuppoſe that they prepared all theſe things. Surely that honeſt houſholder ſupplyed them with all theſe things, and that moſt cheerfully too, to the great hazard of his life. A great ſhame to all them that in other things are very prodigal, but to Chriſt and his people they are miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly penurious.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">John 13.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Now before the feaſt of the Paſsover, when Jeſus knew that his hour was come that he ſhould depart out of this world unto the Father, having loved his own which were in this world, he loved them unto the end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning Chriſts foreknowledge of the time and hour of his death, we have ſpoken already. This the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> do very often and carefully inculcate, leſt any Heretick or Unbeliever ſhould ſay, that he was not able to deliver himſelf, and that he did not ſuffer willingly, but being enſnared by the <hi>Jews,</hi> he could not avoid it. And whereas he often ſaid that his hour or time was not yet come, but here ſaith that it was come: we muſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:171778:44"/> not ſo conceive of it, as though ſome malignant planet to Chriſt but favourable to the <hi>Jews,</hi> did then predominate: but that Chriſt himſelf made choyce to dye and ſuffer at this day, this hour, and at this very time, and that upon good ground.</p>

               <p>See now with what an Elegant circumlocution <hi>John</hi> doth ſet forth the death of Chriſt.

And what elſe doth <hi>John</hi> mean by this Periphraſis of words, but the explication of a Chriſtians death? For if the Platoniſts call death a <hi>Metabaſis,</hi> or a paſſing into life, how much more ſhould we Chriſtians ſo think and believe of it? Be glad then O Chriſtians at this Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Definition: for ſuch as Chriſts death was, ſuch ſhall ours be. Now his death was a paſſing to the Father: therefore ſo ſhall ours be alſo, even as Chriſt himſelf ſaid;

                  <hi>I aſcend to my Father, and to your Father.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Note 1.</note>He doth not ſay that his time, but his hour was come; to teach us that there is a certain hour appointed to every man, as it
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:171778:45"/> is ſaid,
<note place="margin">Job 14.</note>
                  <hi>The number of his moneths are with thee, thou haſt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his bounds, that he cannot paſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Note 2.</note>Secondly, To ſhew that his ſuffering would not laſt long So he ſaith to the <hi>Jews,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>this is your hour,</hi> q.d. I have but one hour to ſuffer, and you but one to ſpend your rage.</p>
               <p>Thus the Scripture calleth the whole time of this life but an hour. If thou doſt well, know that thou haſt but an hours time here; that is, but a very little while: do not therefore begrudge thy labour. And even thy effliction laſteth but an hour; let it not then be tedious.
<note place="margin">Pſalm 37.</note> So the proſperity of the wicked continueth but an hour: Fret not thy ſelf becauſe of the evill doers, for yet a little, and he ſhall be no more.</p>
               <p>But as the feaſt of the Paſsover was Chriſts hour, when he would ſuffer and dye: ſo forty years after at the ſame feaſt was his hour, when he inflicted vengeance on the <hi>Jews.</hi> For when they were aſſembled at the Paſsover, the <hi>Romans</hi> beſieged them, and ſhortly after ranſack'd their City.</p>
               <p>We alſo have two hours, one of Mercy, another of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as certainly as there is a time of mercy, ſo certainly may we expect the hour of Judgement. Briefly, the <hi>Evangeliſt John</hi> calleth the death of Chriſt a going away.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>That he might ſhew his power and might. For he could paſs over all thoſe things which yet hindred his approach to the Father:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 107.16.</note> as it is ſaid of him,
<hi>He hath broken the gates of braſs, and cut the bars of iron in ſunder.</hi> Before his death there was no clear paſſage out of this world unto Heaven. And this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is the fruit of his death, he opened thereby, and prepared for us a paſſage to the Father. It is ſignificantly ſaid, not to God, but to the Father, that we ſhould not be afraid to draw nigh unto God, who by Chriſt is now become our Father.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Again, This <hi>going away</hi> may thus be underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>John</hi> would hereby give an account of the Paſsover it ſelf, which ſignifieth a paſſing over: as if he had ſaid, This feaſt hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been celebrated in remembrance of thoſe things that were done in the paſſing or going out of
<hi>Aegypt.</hi> Now there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>paſsing out</hi> at hand, even out of the world unto the Father. In the former going out, <hi>Moſes</hi> was Leader, in this ſecond Chriſt Jeſus is the Captain. As they followed
<hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo let us follow Chriſt. The Jewiſh Paſsover is to go out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:171778:45"/> the Chriſtian Paſsover is to go out of the world to the Father.</p>
               <p>But what did Chriſt when he knew that the hour of his going away was at hand? ſurely he did not forget his friends. He did not leave loving them, for whoſe ſake he was going to ſuffer ſuch a bitter death. And why ſhould he withdraw his love from them who are ſo hated and contemned by and in the world? What then doth Chriſt do? When he had loved his, he loved them unto the end. He did truly love them; and he continued this his love to them indeed unto the end.</p>
               <p>In the firſt clauſe Chriſt ſheweth the reaſon why he was made man, and came into the world. It was not our worthineſs that was any motive thereof;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 143.2.</note> for we were not worthy to receive ſo much as corporall bleſſings from him, much leſs were we worthy of eternall. Nor had we any merit to move him: for we were altogether born in ſin. Neither was it our righteouſneſs that availed any thing; for who ſhall be juſtified in the ſight of God? But it was his boundleſs love, his infinite charity where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he embraced us that allured and invited him thereto. For as the Father out of his great and abundant love ſent his Son, ſo the Son out of his abundant charity undertook and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Embaſſie of the Father. So ſaith <hi>John, herein his love,
<note place="margin">1 John 4.</note> not that we loved him, but that he loved us firſt,.</hi> Moſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly doth <hi>John</hi> ſay, <hi>having loved his own which were in the world.</hi> All creatures were his by creation.
<note place="margin">John 1.</note> It is ſaid of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</hi> But by <hi>his own</hi> is here meant, thoſe whom he choſe to be <hi>his</hi> from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Thine they were,
<note place="margin">John 17.</note> and thou gaveſt them me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaith further, <hi>which were in the world,</hi> leſt any ſhould think he ſpake here of the Angels, who alſo are Chriſts. But he took not the <hi>Nature of Angels, but the ſeed of Abraham.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 2. Phil. 2.</note> He did not appear in the likeneſs of an Angell, but was found in faſhion as a man. And it is ſaid in generall, <hi>having loved his own which were in the world,</hi> leſt any ſhould think that he loved none but his Apoſtles. How he loved his own, may be ſeen by this one thing, in that he came down from Heaven for their ſake; to ſay nothing of the great tokens of his love which he ſhewed to them when he was in earth. But what meaneth that, <hi>He loved them to the end?</hi> It was to ſhew why Chriſt took the Croſs in his way
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:171778:46"/> as he went back again to the Father, when he might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned without danger. His love conſtrained him. He ſaw that his coming down from Heaven was not ſufficient, unleſs alſo he made ſatisfaction for the ſins of men. So that he loved them to the end, <hi>i. e.</hi> he perſevered in his love.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt, in that he left not loving them even to the death: the ungodlineſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> did not hinder him, he was not diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened when his own fled from him and denyed him, leaving him all alone to ſuffer by himſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>He continued his love to them, in that death it ſelf did not put an end to it. <hi>Many waters could not quench it,</hi> Cant 8.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>His love to them laſted to the end; that is, he ſheweth ſigns of it to them in the very laſt day.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>He loved them to the end, that is, with the higheſt and moſt perfect love, than which none could be greater. Greater love hath none, than that a man lay down his life for his friends, which Chriſt did do, <hi>John</hi> 13. Or,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note>He loved them to the end, that is, he gave not over till be had perfectly ſaved them, ſully overcome ſin, death, and all the curſes of the Law.</p>
               <p>Now then <hi>John</hi> doth ſo ſingularly commend the love of Chriſt, and ſet it forth in the beginning or entrance of his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his laſt Supper.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>To ſhew that all things which followed after, proceeded from nothing but the love of Chriſt, as the Inſtitution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the waſhing of their feet, his moſt loving inſtructions, and the very Paſſion it ſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>On the other hand to ſtir us up to love Chriſt, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>For our Confolation, that we ſhould not think Gods love to us cometh to an end. For he doth not love once only, or only our Fathers, but he loveth to the end, for ever and ever. He abideth faithfull, he cannot deny himſelf, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Deareſt friends, let this love of Chriſt ſatisfie us. It matters not whether the world doth love or hate us, ſo long as we are ſure that Chriſt loveth us, that we are in his heart, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardeth us much, that he careth for us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What hurt can the hatred of the world now do us? <hi>If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</hi> Rom. 8.

               </p>
               <p>Here beginneth the Supper.
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> In the evening of the fourteenth day of the firſt moneth, the paſchal Lamb was to be ſlain and eaten. Chriſt therefore doth well begin at the figure, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed unto the Truth. Firſt, He eateth the Legal Lamb, then he inſtituteth his new Supper, and offereth himſelf to be eaten by thoſe that are his. And whereas the Law required to eat the Paſchal Lamb ſtanding, no doubt but Chriſt obſerved it: and though it be ſaid, he ſate, that is meant after he had eaten the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Lamb.</p>
               <p>Firſt then he ſtood with his Diſciples and did eat the paſchall Lamb, that he might wholly fulfill the Law, and bring it to an honourable end; for he came not to deſtroy but to fulfill it. When he had ſo done, he ſate down, and happily then began the true Supper. He had finiſhed the former already, that old one; but his own, which he principally intended, he had not yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun. To the other a roaſted Lamb was required, but to this nothing but bread and wine. Therefore between both Suppers he doth interpoſe a few words, whereby he gave them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that he meant to aboliſh the Old Teſtament, and to make a new one.</p>
               <p>He expreſt the great affection of his heart to them at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. <hi>With deſire have I deſired,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had ſaid, My deareſt Babes, ye know very well that I have obſerved the Paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over every year; but never with ſo great a deſire as I do now. For now the time is come that I will give you ſuch meat and drink as ye never yet taſted at this Jewiſh Feſtivall. And I am glad that the time is come, for I deſire nothing more. To mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row I muſt ſuffer a moſt bitter death: therefore I muſt diſpatch the Supper this night. This is the laſt time I ſhall ſup with you, I ſhall never more eat with you on earth as now we do. Hence
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:171778:47"/> he preſently addeth, <hi>Hereafter I will no more eat of it,</hi> &amp;c. And, <hi>henceforth I will no more drink of the fruit of the Vine:</hi> in which words he plainly ſheweth that he was about to ſuffer. And a dead man doth neither eat nor drink.</p>
               <p>Now leſt his Diſciples ſhould be too much grieved at this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth ſpeech, he ſaith further for their comfort, <hi>untill it be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in the Kingdom of God;</hi> And, <hi>till I drink it new with you in the Kingdom of my Father.</hi> Both ſpeeches have the ſame ſenſe: for they have reſpect to the joyfull Reſurrection of Chriſt. When Chriſt roſe from the dead the Paſsover was fulfilled. All was imperfect till then. Every one of the former Feaſts were defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. For till that time there was but only the ſhadow and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Paſsover, as alſo all other things under <hi>Moſes.</hi> When Chriſt roſe, the true Paſsover began; for then all things were fulfilled which belonged to the Paſsover.</p>
               <p>And this ſaith he,
<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.</hi> For then the Kingdom of God ſhall come in all Reſpects, of which it was ſaid before, that it drew nigh. As if he had ſaid, till I am dead and riſen again, the kingdom of God is not come. But then my heavenly and ſpiritual Kingdom ſhall mightily be begun in all the world, when I ſhall die for the ſins of men, and riſe again for their juſtification:
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> then I ſay, the whole world ſhall plainly ſee and know by the Word and Spirit, that the Son of God is King, and raigneth over the ſoul and conſcience, which Kingdom of his is now covered with the Croſs.</p>
               <p>What then did he promiſe ſhould be after all things were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, and the Kingdom of God made manifeſt? He promiſed that he would eat the Paſsover again with them, and drink wine, but new wine, and after another manner than before; which may be underſtood two wayes:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt, Of his corporall eating, when he did eat of a broiled fiſh, and Honey comb with his Diſciples after his Reſurrection. Then he did eat with them again corporally, but not as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It was not for any bodily neceſſity (for a glorious body needeth not meat) but fully to prove and evidence the truth of his Reſurrection. Chriſt then promiſed that he would eat bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again with them after his Reſurrection, though (as I ſaid) after another manner: of which
<hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>we did eat and drink with him after he roſe from the dead.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 10.41.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:171778:47"/>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>But the better ſenſe of the words, is of the ſpiritual eating and drinking. For after the ſolemnity of this Jewiſh Feaſt, Chriſt did never more eat of the paſchal Lamb. But he eateth the new Paſsover or Lamb with us, and drinketh the new wine with us in the Kingdom of God, in the Church, when we with him, and he with us, are incorporated by Faith, and receiving the Sacrament; which is not for once, but ever, as long as the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt laſteth in the Church.</p>
               <p>Hereby then he intimateth, that the corporall eating of the Lamb ſhould ceaſe, and that we ſhould ſpiritually eat of the true Lamb. The firſt Lamb was not therefore commanded to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered and eaten becauſe it ſhould alwayes be ſo done. Indeed <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid,<note place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> this ſhould be kept as an Ordinance for ever, but he ſaith alſo, throughout your Generations, <hi>viz,</hi> as long as this generation continueth: ſo long as this ſtate of things, this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, this old Teſtament laſteth, and as long as ye continue the people of God, ſo long this Ceremony ſhall endure. But after Chriſt there is another generation, another Teſtament: nor are the <hi>Jews</hi> any longer the people of God; ſo that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of that Paſchal Lamb ceaſed. This the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> foretold: <hi>Behold the dayes come, when it ſhall be no more ſaid, the Lord liveth that brought the children of Iſrael out of Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Jer.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, we now eat the true and new Paſsover in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, in the Church, wherein God truly raigneth, and is acknowledged as King. Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Paul, is our Paſsover.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.7.

Thus you ſee that this Lamb was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a figure of Chriſt: when the Truth is come, there is no need of type or ſhadow. The <hi>Jews</hi> then are miſtaken, who think themſelves yet bound to legall obſervations. So do the <hi>Ebionites</hi> err too, who ſay, that becauſe Chriſt did eat the Lamb after the
<hi>Jews</hi> manner when he inſtituted the Sacrament, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we alſo ſhould do the like: it is very falſe. For certain it is that Chriſt is the true Lamb, and the true Paſsover.

The world is full of diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and diverſity of opinions in matters of Religion and ſaith: every one pleads for the preheminence of his own. Give ſome allowance to this man, who was but a man, yet doubleſs a godly

                  <p>This is the moſt ſacred Supper of Jeſus Chriſt which he made, and moſt religiouſly obſerved with his Diſciples, near about the time, or a little after the <hi>Jews</hi> Paſsover. The words of the
<hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt</hi> are here to be obſerved with all diligence, pondered ſeriouſly in the heart, held faſt with a ſtedfaſt and unſhaken me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, ſpecially in theſe dangerous dayes now there are ſo many diſſentions and conteſts about theſe words, when every perſon almoſt fancieth to himſelf a particular Maſs and Sacrament. It is much to be lamented, that ſince there was a Church, no Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine or Article of Faith ever raiſed ſo much ſtrife and miſchief, notwithſtadding there is not any thing more comfortable to the Church. Good God! what hath not Satan attempted to do againſt this Sacrament? What horrid errours, what differences and diſſentions hath he ſtirred up againſt it? none can expreſs the miſery and calamity thereof. The Devill hath and doth try all wayes to render this Sacrament ineffectuall to us. And, wo, and alas, he hath prevailed on too many. But I ſhall not now repeat thoſe manifold Errours which Satan hath ſet on foot about this Sacrament. It would require much time, nor can any tongue eaſily utter them. It were to be wiſhed, that no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian would ſeek to know or think any more of them. Would to God they were all buried, and that we might all of us em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the pure Text of the
<hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and ſo be edified in the true Chriſtian life. O that the Lord God would give ſuch an heart unto all Monarchs, Princes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> as to ſuppreſs this up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart, ſcandalous and moſt abominable diſcord about this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For things are come to that paſs now, that this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is become the greateſt occaſion of all ſecret grudges, ſtrifes and variance in Chriſtianity. O unfpeakable grief! The Church is now rent and torn by that which ſhould unite and ſoder it: that which ſhould ſerve ut chiefly for peace and Unity, that we abuſe and turn into war, ſtrife, ſects and factions. The Lord look down from Heaven, and viſit his Vineyard which is now ſo miſerably laid waſte. The good and moſt gracious God grant that the Church may ſo believe, think, and teach concerning the holy Euchariſt, even as the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and
<hi>Paul,</hi> and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:171778:49"/> Orthodox men have taught and written of it. Where this is not, no peace can be expected, although Councils ſhould be called every day. The Goſpel and Orthodox Fathers agree well enough: They think and teach alike, are all one in their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I wiſh our yong Divines and Sectarian Noveliſts could accord among themſelves. But there can never be any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hoped for till we lay aſide our paſſions and confidence of our own Reaſon, and ſtick to the words of the
<hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and unanimous conſent of the Fathers. And why ſhould we be ſo averſe and backward to this? Who art thou O man, that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the words of God, nay that oppoſeſt the very words of God? How wilt thou anſwer at the day of Judgement, or what excuſe wilt thou have then to eſcape the wrath of God?</p>
                  <p>To ye, O Princes, Biſhops and Doctors do I ſpeak theſe things. The neglect will light heavy on ye. Ye ſee, know &amp; plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive what courſe ſhould be taken, yet ye forbear. Ye ſee, I ſay, how many abominable, horrid, and altogether inſufferable errors are crept into the Church concerning this Sacrament: ye ſee how ridiculouſly, how ſcornfully, how wantonly, yea how immodeſtly this Sacrament is obſerved. But why ſpeak I to them that have ears but will not hear, and eyes but ſee not? Their heart is blinded by the righteous Judgement. We entreat thee, O Chriſt, have mercy upon thy Church: if thou wilt, thou only art able, &amp; thou art moſt concerned in it. It is thy Supper, thy Example, thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, thy Church that is in diſtreſs. And for its ſake are we ſtreightned, ſeeing and beholding thoſe great diſcords and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive damages. This ſacrifice of praiſe is more trampled under foot than any; thy Body is diſown'd, thy words are wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thy Precept neglected: New Doctrines are coyn'd, a New cuſtom of the Sacrament gets ground. In ſhort, the loſs is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than any tongue can expreſs. And to whom ſhall we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of theſe things, but unto thee? for none elſe will vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe an ear to us. We beſeech thee by thy moſt holy and moſt bitter Paſſion, of which we have begun here to treat, ſtir up the hearts of our Biſhops, and ſo effectually touch their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, that they may take better heed in obſerving and diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thy Supper than heretofore they have done,

                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:171778:50"/> Conſider firſt who ſpake theſe words, even Chriſt. Whence tis plain, this Sacrament was not invented by man, but is of Divine Inſtitution, and therefore to contemn, ſcoffe, or under value it, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Again, If it be Gods inſtitution, ſee thou pry not too curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly into every particular. For theſe Myſteries are not to be found out by reaſon, but by Faith Obſerve how Chriſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it: when he had ended the legall Supper, he ſaid, that he would eat &amp; drink with them no more. There was nothing more to be done but to give thanks, and ſo riſe from table. Which when it was done,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>o then he taketh bread again, he bleſſeth it again, he breaks it by it ſelf, he ſets it before them, and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it among his Dſciples, bidding them eat it, none of which things he did in the legall Supper that we read of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>Laſtly, To all this he addeth,
<hi>This is my Body.</hi> Who would not wonder at ſuch unaccuſtomed behaviour which he here uſed? For what elſe did he intend by all this, but that all men ſhould diligently attend unto thoſe things which follow, even that we ſhould know that this bread, and this wine was not now common bread and wine, ſuch as they had in eating the Lamb: but another thing far more ſingular and excellent, even his body and blood. Therefore when the Diſciples ſaw theſe unuſual geſtures of Chriſt, they did not gainſay or enquire about it, but ſimply believed, nothing doubting but that there was ſome great matter in hand. Conſider therefore what Chriſt ſaith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Take and eat,</hi> in which word, he promiſeth to beſtow ſome great thing upon them. And indeed what elſe ſhould a man look for from a Saviour, a Chriſt, a God, but ſome great, excellent and moſt advantagious things?
<note place="margin">Eſ. 32.8. Luke 11.</note> It becomes a great man to be magnificently bountifull. <hi>If ye that are evill know how to give good things to your children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give the good Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> Take then, and make your ſelves to receive whatſoever ſuch a Lord ſhall beſtow upon you. For it cannot be that a Saviour ſhould offer any evil, burtfull, or vain thing. But whereas he ſaith, <hi>EAT,</hi> he ſheweth to what purpoſe the Sacrament was inſtituted, to
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:171778:50"/> wit, that it ſhould be received. Bread doth no good, except be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten, it be incorporated.</p>
                  <p>So then by this word is ſignified, that this is not ſimply to be taken as a gift, but ſo as that it might be united to us: nor ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, but ſo as that it might become one body with us, even as the bread which we eat is turned into our nature, who are nouriſhed by it.</p>
                  <p>But that this Metaphor of eating may be the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, remember that there is nothing in us but ſin, death, curſe and hell: there is no righteouſneſs, life, ſalvation, or Grace; we are indeed deſtitute of all that is good. But Chriſt hath all theſe good things in himſelf; yet not for himſelf only, but for us alſo, and for that reaſon he calleth himſelf <hi>the bread of Life.</hi> For as bread is not made for it ſelf, but to ſtrengthen them that eat it: ſo Chriſt hath not theſe good things for himſelf alone, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth them to us alſo. But after what manner? How can we partake of the life and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, ſeeing we have no righteouſneſs or life in us? Anſw. By feeding upon him. Then we find the vertue of bread when it is incorporated in us. Then thou perceiveſt what vertue and good there is in Chriſt, when thou receiveſt Chriſt into thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>Now Chriſt is offered two manner of wayes unto us: in the Word, and in the Sacrament. So alſo do we eat his body two wayes: Spiritually, and Sacramentally. Of the ſpiritual eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſaith thus, <hi>he that cometh to me ſhall not hunger, and he that believeth in me ſhall not thirſt.</hi> From which words it is clear, that to eat Chriſts body ſpiritually, is to believe with the heart, that Chriſt was made man, and took our ſins upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he ſhed his blood for us and conquered hell, and that he reconciled us unto God. He that believeth this, doth as is it were ſnatch Chriſt by faith, and throw him into himſelf, and is become one body with him; whereby it cometh to paſs, that he doth not hunger in ſin, for he hath the righteouſneſs of Chriſt: he doth not hunger in death, for he hath the life of Chriſt; nor in malediction, for he hath the benediction of Chriſt; nor in afflictions, becauſe he ſeeth his deliverance by Chriſt. This ſpiritual eating is neceſſary to all, for none can be ſaved without it. If we partake not of the Righteouſneſs and Life of Chriſt, what do we but abide in our ſins and death? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:171778:51"/> Chriſt himſelf ſaith,
<note place="margin">John 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Except ye eat the fleſh of the ſon of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.</hi> He doth not ſpeak here of the Sacrament; for all are not damned that do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacrament: but he ſpeaks of the ſpiritual eating by faith,
<note place="margin">Heb 11.</note> without which no man can pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>After this manner the Fathers of the old Teſtament alſo did eat the body of Chriſt; for Chriſt was offered to them too by Word and Promiſes. Without this ſpiritual eating, the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is nothing available, nay it doth hurt and condemn, becauſe it is received unworthily.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Here then you ſee, that Chriſt is not offered unto us only in the Word, but alſo in the Sacrament; to this end, even to put us in mind of the Promiſes by this outward ſign, and that we ſhould be aſſured by this corporal eating, that Chriſt with all that he hath was truly given to us. For he that gave his very body, what elſe will he deny? We may now ſee that this exte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal eating was not inſtituted in vain, as ſome ungodly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful men prate. What need was there, ſay they, of an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſign, when it is faith that taketh all the good things of Chriſt to it ſelf? And who art thou, wretched man, that dareſt reprove God in his what he doth, as if he had not ordained all things wiſely? I might alſo reaſon after that manner, what need was there for Chriſt to take our fleſh and ſuffer? And what need is there of preaching the Goſpel? God could have reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red man by his Word only, as he did create him only by his Word. Is therefore the Incarnation, Paſſion and Goſpel of Chriſt to no purpoſe? See how unthankfull we are. But God was willing to communicate his good things to us many wayes: yea his own Son, to wit, by his Incarnation, by the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And who art thou unthankful man, that durſt queſtion why he would do ſo, and what need there was of it? Thou ſhouldeſt rather exceedingly rejoyce, that God would be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to impart his good things to thee, which way ſoever he did beſtow them.</p>
                  <p>This is one of Satans old tricks,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> whereby he cheated <hi>Eve; Why,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>did God command that you ſhould not eat of this tree?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 12.</note> To what purpoſe? what need was there for it? And this way he ſeeks to deceive us.
<note place="margin">Gen 22.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> did not reaſon ſo: <hi>what need have I to leave my own Country? Thou mayeſt do me good
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:171778:51"/> where I am.</hi> Again, To what end ſhould I offer my Son? He ſaid no ſuch thing, but preſently obeyed. The Nature of faith is to ſhut the eyes of reaſon, and to go blindfold after the naked Word of God. So ſhould we do in this caſe. But hear what Chriſt ſaith further.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is my Body.</hi> Here you have the other and more principal part of the Sacrament, to wit, the Word of God. The viſible Bread is one part; the Word of Chriſt is the other. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrament is made up of theſe two, that is, the outward Sign, and the Word of God, which muſt not be ſeparated one from the other. The Word was added to the Element, and ſo became a Sacrament. The bread is ſeen, the Word of Chriſt is heard. Which of theſe is of moſt credit? the ſight,
<note place="margin">The Truth of Chriſts Body.</note> or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? ſurely the hearing; for he that ſpeaks is God. Therefore all the vertue of the Sacraments is from the Word of God. When the Word cometh to the Bread, it is no more what it was before, but ſomewhat elſe far more excellent, by reaſon of the Word of God added to it. For the Word of God is of that efficacy that it can do all things; which is moſt clearly manifeſt, both from the firſt creation of all things, as alſo from thoſe Miracles which wrought by the Word of God. For concerning both,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 148.5.</note> he ſpake the word and they were made: yea the Word of God, is God; <hi>It is the Wiſdom and Power of God, Rom.</hi> 1. <hi>John</hi> 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. When God therefore by his Word joyneth his Vertue, Power and Name to the outward thing, who doubteth but that ſome new and great thing is thereby wrought? How then durſt any be ſo bold to ſay that there is nothing but bare bread in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament after the words (of Conſecration) are uttered? Is the Word of God, which is ſo powerfull in every thing elſe, of no force in this Sacrament?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>Theſe words then <hi>(This is my Body)</hi> do prove the truth of Chriſts body in the Sacrament. So that we are moſt highly to eſteem the words of God. Nor can there be any trope or figure in them. For firſt, nothing can more abſolutely be ſpoken, if all the tongues in the world ſhould ſpeak together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Beſides, there is not one of the
<hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> no nor <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was a moſt ſincere Preacher of the Goſpel, that ever hinted the leaſt letter of a trope in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>Laſtly, There is no juſt reaſon can be alledged why theſe words
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:171778:52"/> ſhould be otherwiſe underſtood. We muſt therefore keep to theſe words, as to the moſt undoubted and ſafe ſayings of God himſelf which do not deceive, nor ſuffer to be deceived. He that addeth to theſe words, God ſhall add to him the plagues,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Apoc. 21.</note>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Benefit.</note>So then if (as hath been proved) the Body of Chriſt be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according to the tenor of the words, in the Sacrament, it is certain that the Sacrament it ſelf cannot be an unprofitable thing. For it is evident, that the fleſh of Chriſt was filled with the God-head. If therefore God be nothing worth, then alſo is the fleſh of Chriſt of no value. When that fleſh of Chriſt walked on the earth, it did good to all that it did but touch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo little, by reaſon of the Godhead that dwelt in it. How can it be then that it ſhould do no good in the Sacrament, ſince it is the ſame fleſh of Chriſt, in Union with the ſame Divinity? it is alſo the ſame word of God, of the ſame Nature and force now as ever it was.</p>
                  <p>But take notice, that Chriſt in this Sacrament gave us not his Body alone, but his Blood too. As in the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> there was a ſacrifice to be ſlain, and moreover a cleanſing by blood: ſo the Body of Chriſt was the ſacrifice, and his Blood the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away of ſins; the ſacrifice of his body maketh ſatisfaction, his blood purifieth: the offering is made to God for Reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the blood is poured out to make us clean.</p>
                  <p>Now in the diſtribution of his blood he obſerveth the ſame geſtures as he did in the diſtribution of his body. He took it, he gave thanks, he gave it to them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the words he added, at leaſt altered ſomething. For he doth not ſay ſimply <hi>(Hic eſt ſanguis meus) This is my blood:</hi> as he ſaid, <hi>(Hoc eſt corpus meum) This is my body:</hi> But he addeth, <hi>This is the blood of the New Teſtament:</hi> Or as <hi>Paul</hi> hath it, <hi>This cup is the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament in my blood:</hi> by which word he plainly alludeth to the confirmation of the old Teſtament; as when <hi>Moſes</hi> had read all the Law, he took the blood of the Calf, and therewith ſprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the people, ſaying,
<note place="margin">Exod. 24.</note>
                     <hi>Behold the blood of the Covenant, which God hath made with you,</hi> &amp;c. In like manner Chriſt here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. By how much the blood of Chriſt is more excellent than the blood of a Bull, ſo much the new Teſtament is more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy than the old.</p>

That the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament may be ſure, Chriſt himſelf the Teſtator died: and that we might remember his death, he did affix as it were two ſeals unto it, the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.
<note place="margin">The ſenſe of the words.</note> Therefore when he ſaith, <hi>Take, eat: Take, drink</hi> &amp;c. his meaning is this: Lo, I promiſe you all my goods, and do freely beſtow them on you: and to make this firm and ſure to you, I am about to die, and, in witneſs whereof I ſet to my Seal, I leave you my body &amp; blood. He maketh mention of a Teſtament when he ſpeaketh, not of his body, but of his blood. The ſhedding of blood is a ſign of death, by which death the Teſtament is ratified.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he addeth at laſt, ſpeaking of his body, <hi>Which ſhall be given for you:</hi> but concerning his blood, ſaith he, <hi>Which ſhall be ſhed for you:</hi> he plainly ſheweth, that the ſame body which was crucified and ſlain, and the ſame blood which was ſhed upon the Croſs, is received in the Sacrament. Theſe words alſo ſhew the fruit of the Euchariſt, which is to partake of the merit of Chriſts Paſſion; Whereunto Faith is requiſite, not only to believe that the body and blood of Chriſt is here preſent, but withall to believe that it is the ſame body which was offered for us, and the ſame blood which was ſhed for us, and that it is given to us, which Chriſt merited by his death.</p>
                  <p>Take notice alſo of what is ſaid concerning his blood, which is ſhed (not for all, but) for many. Indeed the blood of Chriſt was ſufficient for all, but all do not believe. It is fitly ſaid, <hi>not for all, but for many:</hi> which is a word of terrour to the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and thoſe that are too ſecure, who flatter themſelves that they cannot be damned.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt addeth in the cloſe, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> Where we ſee, that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> do not only deſcribe the thing as it was once done, but they ſet it down ſo as a thing ever hereafter to be obſerved and continued. Whence Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Apoſtles that they ſhould do as he had done: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:171778:53"/> ſignifying that he would alwayes be preſent at his Sacrament, and that what he by himſelf did at the Supper, the ſame ſhould be done by the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors. So that they are much miſtaken who ſay, I believe that Chriſt &amp; the Apoſtles did conſecrate it; but I do not believe that every Prieſt can do it. I believe that the Saints do receive the body of Chriſt, but I do not think ſinners do. Hear me Brother: the Sacraments of the Church are not founded on our worthineſs or unworthineſs, but upon the Word of God: whatever the Miniſter or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant be, Gods Ordinance is the ſame. As neither Angel nor man could of themſelves turn bread into the body of Chriſt, ſo neither of them can hinder it. Therefore he doth not ſay, if thou receive it worthily, thou ſhalt take my body: but, <hi>This is my Body:</hi> ſo the Creed the Lords Prayer, and the Commandments of God,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> remain good and valid, though thou never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt, if thou doſt not pray, work, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as Gods outward works alwayes continue though we abuſe them.</p>
                  <p>But it is moſt to be obſerved that Chriſt here commandeth and ſpeaks imperatively, and chargeth us to take and eat, and to do as he did: whereby tis plain, that we are not left at our li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to obſerve or neglect this Sacrament. If thou art a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, thou muſt ſometimes obey this Command. Chriſt hath commanded it, though he appointed no ſet time. It is not in our choice wholly to omit it. When he ſaith,
<hi>in remembrance of me,</hi> his will is that this Sacrament ſhould be,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>A Monument of his Charity towards us, whereby he gave himſelf to us in every reſpect, as a companion, a brother, a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, meat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Who is ſo hard as not to melt into a mutual love by all theſe ſigns of love?</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>A remembrance of that ſacrifice which Chriſt offered up for us at his death upon the Croſs, as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note>
                     <hi>As often as ye eat,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ye ſhew the Lords death ill he come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ye ſee after what manner, at what time, and with what words Chriſt inſtituted the Sacrament, all which are of ſuch concernment, that tis ſtrange if they kindle not in us a deſire of ſo great good, inflame our love to God, and encourage us to give praiſe and thanks unto him. We commend and thank him that giveth us an eſtate at his death to make us rich. Why ſhould we not do ſo here? But ſometimes we may find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:171778:53"/> heirs in the world; ſo (alas for it) doth Chriſt find by experience that we are too unthankfull unto him. Now the ſleighting what is ſet before us, is no ſmall cauſe of this our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude. And ſo that is too often fulfill'd in us which
<hi>Eliſha</hi> once ſaid to the incredulous Noble man,
<note place="margin">2 King. 7.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt ſee it with thine eyes, but thou ſhalt not eat thereof.</hi> Are not theſe things ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd in us? We ſee, and have theſe great things before our eyes, and in our hands, yet we perceive them not, we taſte them not. What greater evil can befall a man than to have riches and not enjoy them? Two things yet remain to be conſidered about this Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> to what end it was ordained, and how it ought to be received. It was ordained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>That our heart ſhould more cloſely cleave to the words and Promiſes of God. The Prophets promiſed that the time ſhould come when God would dwell in us, and that Chriſt by his death would take away our ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which and the like Promiſes are confirmed by this Sacrament: He inſtituted this Sacrament that we ſhould not doubt of theſe things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>It is a ſtanding Monument of his Charity, that ſo we might never doubt of his good will to us. Whenſoever then our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences are ready to flag and fail, which often happeneth, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally at death, they ſhould be ſtrengthened by this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>It is a perpetual Remembrance and Repreſentation of that only ſacrifice, which was offered for us upon the Croſs. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this Sacrament may be taken out of the words of
<hi>Paul,</hi> when he ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>
                     <hi>The bread which we break, is it not the Communion of the body of Chriſt?</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 10. Whereby he ſheweth, that by this Sacrament we partake of all the good things of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Another fruit of it is, that we alſo are made one bread, and one body, even all that partake of one bread, and of one cup: that is, This Sacrament doth put us in mind, that we are made one meat and one drink; and that we ſhould wholly devote our ſelves to the good of our Neighbours; that we ſhould make the poverty of others our own: and account the faults of others as our own, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore in Greek it is called <hi>Synaxis,</hi> that is, a communication. Whence we may eaſily gather, what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to the worthy receiving of it: which is nowhere more clearly expreſt than in the figure of the Paſchal Lamb, and the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:171778:54"/> 
                     <hi>Manna.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Paſchal Lamb.</note> Both which figures I ſhall briefly open. Concerning the Lamb conſider,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>The houſe muſt be ſprinkled with the blood of the Lamb in three places,
<note place="margin">Exod. 12.7.</note> on the door, and both the poſts. So he that will come to the Sacrament, muſt firſt be ſealed with the Seal of the holy Trinity, which is done in Baptiſm. Or thus, he muſt be marked in three places, that is, he ſhould have the three Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; Baptiſm, Confirmation and Repentance. Or, the blood of the Lamb muſt be on his doors, <hi>i. e.</hi> he ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes have the remembrance of Chriſts Paſſion before his eyes, when he goeth out, and when he cometh in, according to that of <hi>Paul,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> As oft as ye eat, ye ſhall ſhew the Lords death,</hi> &amp;c. Or, he ſhould have the Lambs blood on the doors, <hi>i. e.</hi> he muſt not be aſhamed of the Croſs of Chriſt, nor bluſh to keep the Commands of Chriſt, but openly confeſs that he doth believe and keep them.</p>
                  <p>To that which the Author hath here obſerved,
<note place="margin">The Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement. Heb.
10.29.</note> concerning this firſt circumſtance, the Tranſlator further addeth, <hi>viz.</hi> They were not to ſtrike any of the Lambs blood on the threſhold; nor ſhould we tread the blood of the Son of God under foot; But they were to ſtrike the blood on the lintel. So ſhould we alwayes have the blood of Chriſt over our heads, above our own reaſon, in higher eſtimation than the reach of our natural capacity, or growth and ſtature of our earthly man, our carnal mind; It ſhould be over our head, to be ſeen only by Faith, lifting our heads upward from earthy things, thoughts, deſires, affections, confidence, righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> unto heavenly things: looking on it as a Propitiation, a Reconciliation, a Mediation, ſomething between Heaven and earth, between God and man; as that which reconcileth us unto God,
<note place="margin">Heb. 12.24.</note> and giveth us boldneſs at his Throne of Grace, <hi>ſpeaking better things than that of</hi> Abel. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, they were to ſtrike both the ſide poſts, one as well as the other: We ſhould have the blood of Chriſt on either hand, that we may ſee God on the leſt hand where he worketh; and on the right hand where he hideth himſelf:
<note place="margin">Job 23.9.</note> that we may be kept in proſperity and adverſity, knowing how to want and how to abound, both in reſpect of the outward and inward man, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from exceſs and all extreams, ſwallowed up neither with preſumption nor deſpair, but fighting the good fight of Faith,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:171778:54"/> having the Armour of Righteouſneſs on the right hand,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.7.</note> and on the left. Now we proceed with the Author.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>They muſt eat the fleſh roaſted with fire that night. The fleſh of Chriſt muſt be eaten by night. It muſt be by Faith alone, and the eyes of Reaſon muſt be ſhut. Tis true, our fleſh would eat it in the day, that is, it coveteth to ſee all things, but all in vain. The fleſh of Chriſt is eaten inviſibly, and in a Myſterie. And the fleſh of our Lamb may well be ſaid to be roaſted; for it is roaſted with the fire of Tribulation, as alſo with the fire and operation of the Holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>It was to be eaten with unleavened bread. The fleſh of the Lamb muſt not be eaten alone, that is, we muſt not only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what Chriſt did, but what we alſo ought to do;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.</note> we muſt firſt of all caſt out the leaven of malice and wickedneſs: the Sacrament muſt be received with the unleavened bread of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and truth. For this food is not provided for dogs, but for Children only; not for filthy perſons, but ſuch as are clean. They ſin therefore who come to it not having firſt repented of their ſins.</p>

                     <note place="margin">4.</note>With wild Lettice (ſo the
<hi>vulg. Lat.</hi>) bitter herbs, or as it is in the Hebrew, with (or upon) bitterneſſes, <hi>i. e.</hi> with a bitter remembrance of our ſins. Thus the Diſciples did eat this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with bitter Herbs: for they were very ſad at the words of Chriſt, and during all thoſe three dayes of his Paſſion, they were together in great heavineſs. So we eat it with bitter herbs if we afflict our body, inaſmuch as the bitterneſs of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance purgeth the humour of an ill life out of the ſtomach of the mind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">5.</note>Ye ſhall not eat it raw, nor ſodden with water. They eat it raw who come to it without any premeditation.

They eat it raw who underſtand all things carnally, and ſay with the <hi>Capernaites,
<note place="margin">John 6</note> This is a hard ſaying, who can hear it?</hi> They eat it boiled in water, who ſtrive by their carnal reaſon to find out how this may be ſo. The water of our wiſdom cannot boil this Lamb, cannot ſearch out and comprehend theſe Myſteries.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:171778:55"/> is hard, nothing impoſſible. As therefore we do rightly acknowledge the man that was born of a Virgin to be God: ſo truly do we ſay, that is Chriſt which we take at the Altar, and do preach him to be the Lamb of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">6.</note>Ye ſhall eat the head with the feet and the entrails. We muſt take whole Chriſt, and not divide him. Some Hereticks have thrown away the Head, denying the Divinity of Chriſt: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have caſt away the feet, not acknowledging his Humanity. Others his entrails, ſaying, that Chriſt had no ſoul. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt men now adayes receive Chriſt by halves only. They have an ear for his Promiſes, but not for his Precepts: They take him only as a gift, not as an Example. The Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to take the Head, and Feet, the Divinity and Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the Promiſes and Precepts of the true Lamb. And it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall eat,</hi> or ye ſhall <hi>devour:</hi> in which word our lazy drowſineſs is reproved, who can hardly be driven to this Sacrament, to which we ſhould rather run with all cheerfulneſs.

<note place="margin">

<hi>John</hi> it plainly appeareth that the <hi>Manna</hi> did prefigure Chriſt. <hi>For Moſes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>gave you not the true bread from Heaven, but my Father giveth it,</hi> &amp;c. And a little after, <hi>I am the living bread</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed.</hi> Whatſoever then is written in that Hiſtory, doth refer either to the Humanity of Chriſt, or to the Word, or to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.

                  <p>There are four things mentioned of the <hi>Manna:</hi> firſt, the cauſe; ſecondly, the form and nature of it; thirdly, the manner of gathering it; fourthly, its uſe.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why God gave the Children of <hi>Iſrael Manna</hi> from Heaven, was, firſt the peoples hunger. And Chriſt ſaith,

<hi>Pſam</hi> 12 5.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>God gave the <hi>Iſraelites Manna,</hi> to ſhew his Truth, Power, Righteouſneſs, Goodneſs. He gave his own Son alſo to declare the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>He did it alſo to prove them. To that end alſo did Chriſt come
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:171778:56"/> poor and humble. Wherefore he did not preach the Goſpel him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> but by his Apoſtles. And therefore he doth not exhibite himſelf viſibly, but inviſibly in the Sacrament, to try whether we will believe though we do not ſee him. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he doth truly try us in the Sacrament. For as the firſt man did believe the Devil more than God, concerning the forbidden food: ſo Chriſt in this Sacrament would have us (for expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the former fault) believe his words rather than our ſelves, our own ſenſe or reaſon.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the Faſhion and Properties of this
<hi>Mavna,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The faſhion and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it.</note> the Scripture ſaith:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was very ſmall, little in ſhew, and but a deſpicable thing, but it was of great vertue: ſo is Chriſt, the Word of God, and ſo is this Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>Manna</hi> was white and clear. Chriſt is clean from all ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>Manna</hi> was beaten in a Morter. Chriſt was bruiſed with the peſtle of his Paſſion, and in the preſs of the Croſs, that his precious blood might flow forth every way.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Manna</hi> taſted like Hony. Chriſt is ſweet to all that are afflicted: having the ſame ſmack in the Word and Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Manna</hi> pleaſed every ones palat, and reliſhed according to his deſire that did taſte it. In Chriſt and in the Sacrament every mans deſire is anſwered. The ſick find health, the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner pardon, the Righteous ſweetneſs, the afflicted find com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort therein.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Manna</hi> came down from Heaven. Chriſt and this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are given to us from Heaven. That deſcended with a dew, Chriſt came down with Grace and Truth.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <hi>Manna</hi> made all men wonder and admire. So this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is truly moſt worthy of all admiration.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. The <hi>Manna</hi> was common to all: ſo is the Sacrament, it ſufficeth all as the <hi>Manna</hi> did.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The <hi>Manna</hi> fell every day. Chriſt is alwayes with us in the Sacrament, even to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi>

                  <p n="10">10. He that gathered much of the <hi>Manna</hi> had nothing over, and ſo on the contrary. The pooreſt Believer hath as much as the richeſt in the Sacrament, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> came into the Promiſed Land, the

                  <p n="12">12. Laſtly, The <hi>Manna</hi> was ſaid up in the Temple for a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial to Poſterity. The Sacrament continueth for ever in the Church for a memorial of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the gathering of the <hi>Manna,</hi> the Scripture ſaith:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They were commanded to ſeek it very early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and we are bid to ſeek the Kingdom of God before all things, which is by hearing the Word of God, and receiving the Sacraments.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, They gathered it every day: ſo we ſhould never neglect the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They were to go forth of their tents: ſo we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to go out of the old life, and out of all curioſity of ſence, leſt we judge by our ſight, taſte, or touch, whether the Body of Chriſt be there or no; but we are ſimply to believe the Word of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They were commanded to gather it, not for curioſity, but ſufficiency; ſo ſhould we do in this Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, They gathered a double proportion on the ſixth day, becauſe of the Sabbath following.
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> We are commanded not to ſleep in this laſt hour, but to provide for the future by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of that Steward in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 16,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The way to uſe this <hi>Manna</hi> was to beat it in a Morter,
<note place="margin">The uſe of <hi>Manna.</hi>
                     </note> or to grind it in a Mill, and ſo boyl it. We ſhould conſider the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of this Sacrament, in every piece and fragment of it, and receive them with a contrite heart, ſeething them with the fire of divine Love, and ſo reſt ſatisfied with their ſweetneſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As all were not alike affected with the old
<hi>Manna,</hi> yea ſome indeed loathed it: ſo is it now in the Sacrament,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Good and bad did eat of the old <hi>Manna,</hi> but to a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent end, for many periſhed in the Wilderneſs. So good and bad receive the Sacrament, but ſome to life, others to death, <hi>&amp;c. Chriſt is ſet for the fall, and riſing of many in</hi> Iſrael,
<hi>Luke</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly. The <hi>Manna</hi> ſtank and became nothing worth to ſome. This Sacrament doth little good to ſome; nay,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:171778:57"/> it is the condemnation of thoſe that receive it unworthily.</p>
                  <p>See now how our <hi>Manna</hi> anſwereth in all things to that of old, and how much more excellent it is then that was; for it hath the Fountain of all good eſſentially in it ſelf, nor doth it feed the body only, but ſpecially it nouriſheth the ſoul. It gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Eternal Life; the old <hi>Manna</hi> had no ſuch thing. Let us then be thankfull, and take heed we abuſe not this Heavenly bread.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I ſuppoſe I have made it clear, how expreſly the myſteries of this Sacrament were foreſhewn in thoſe two figures, the
<hi>Paſchal Lamb</hi> and <hi>Manna.</hi> Let us here add a third figure, the Oblation of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 17. Heb. 7.</note> of which we read in
<hi>Geneſis,</hi> for he did moſt exactly typifie Chriſt in Name and Office.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid he was without Father, without Mother, without beginning, without end, alſo King of <hi>Zedek, i. e.</hi> of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and Prince of <hi>Salem, i. e.</hi> of Peace, and Prieſt of the moſt high God: Chriſt truly and moſt abſolutely had all theſe Titles. And as <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> brought bread and wine to
<hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> when he came from the battel, ſo Chriſt in his laſt Supper gave the Sacrament of bread and wine to his Diſciples: he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained and inſtituted it eſpecially for the comfort and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe who bicker and fight with the Devil. And as <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedeck</hi> firſt of all offered bread and wine unto God, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fed <hi>Abraham</hi> and his company therewith: So this our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is not only a refreſhing of the weak and weary, but alſo a ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving to be continued to the end of the world. <hi>This do</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>Moſt properly is it called a Sacrifice; becauſe the true uſe of this Sacrament is to offer thanks and praiſe to God when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, Becauſe here that only ſacrifice is repreſented, and as it were ſet before our eyes, even that ſacrifice which Chriſt offered on the Croſs, whereby the wrath of God was ſtayed by his crucified Son, who putteth him ſtill in mind that he would vouchſafe to be propitious unto us for his death and Paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>To ſay nothing that we by this Sacrament are alſo put in mind to offer our ſelves to God, as Chriſt gave himſelf for us. Thus it may fitly be called a ſacrifice. So then this figure doth
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:171778:57"/> every way anſwer to our Sacrament. All this I have ſpoken the rather to affect us with the greater Faith and Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that moſt ſacred Supper of our Lord. But enough of that. To the Text again.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And ſupper being ended (the Devil having now put into the heart of</hi> Judas Iſcariot, Simons <hi>ſon,
<note place="margin">John 13.2.</note> to betray him)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands: and that he was come from God, and went to God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">verſe 3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He riſeth from ſupper, and laid aſide his garments,
<note place="margin">verſe 4.</note> and took a towel, and girded himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>After that, he poureth water into a Baſon,
<note place="margin">verſe 5.</note> and began to waſh the Diſciples feet, and to wipe them with the Towel wherewith he was girded.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here Jeſus ſheweth his love to his Diſciples. Surely he could not hate them whoſe feet he waſhed. Now we may ſuppoſe that this thing was not done quite after Supper, but as they were yet at ſupper, as may ſeem; firſt, in that tis ſaid, He roſe from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Secondly, it is ſaid, after the waſhing he ſate down again. Thirdly, tis not ſaid,
<hi>coena finita,</hi> ſupper being ended, but <hi>coena facta,</hi> ſupper being made, or made ready; when it was ſet before them on the table.</p>
                  <p>Whence it is that almoſt all are of opinion, he waſhed their feet before the inſtitution of the Euchariſt; and it is very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it was ſo: for it becometh us to come neat and clean unto the Sacrament. But by <hi>John</hi> it ſeems this waſhing was after the inſtitution of the Sacrament. For he continueth the Hiſtory af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the waſhing of their feet, which ſhould not be interrupted till <hi>Judas</hi> was caſt out of fellowſhip. If then the Sacrament was inſtituted afterward, it would follow from the Hiſtory that <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> did not take the body and blood of Chriſt with the reſt of the Apoſtles, which ſome affirm.
<note place="margin">Luke 22</note> But the Hiſtory of
<hi>Luke</hi> doth not admit this: where it is plainly ſaid, that
<hi>Judas</hi> his admonition followed the inſtitution of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>I liſt not to contend about this. It is ſufficient we know that Chriſt did waſh his Diſciples feet, whether it was before, or after the receiving of the Sacrament, it matters not. Let us give heed to the Hiſtory, it is worth our taking notice; and it requireth a diligent Auditour, and a deſirous Spectator. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1, That which Chriſt did here, is very beautiful and to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:171778:58"/> 2. The words of the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> himſelf are moſt prudent; for he doth not ſimply ſhew what was done, but he ſets it out with words of weight and gravity to make the more impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Before he proceeds to what Chriſt did, he firſt nameth the Traytor, that thereby we might either prize the greatneſs of Chriſts love and humility, who ſhewed thoſe things even to an enemy and traytor, which another man would ſcarce diſcloſe to a brother or a friend. It is the greateſt love that can be, to love our enemies, and do good to them that hate us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Or elſe he nameth the traytor, that thereby we may ſee how that wretched man fell from one ſin to another, as being now the very reall and proper ſlave of Satan: yea he ſtill went on to greater ſins, till at laſt he fell into the bottomleſs pit. <hi>John</hi> had before call'd him a thief, who did uſe to pick his Maſters purſe; And a little after the other <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſhew that he had taken money of the <hi>Jews</hi> to betray Chriſt. But here is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of his ſin, in that he obſtinately reſolv'd with himſelf to accompliſh this wickedneſs, and not hearken to any courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies or Counſell: which indeed was a moſt devilliſh thing. Therefore it is remarkably ſaid, that the Devil had caſt it into his heart. The ungodly wretch preſently liſtened to this Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. He ſcorned to hear the admonition of Chriſt, as all wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men do. <hi>I am come in my Fathers Name,</hi> ſaith Chriſt,
<hi>and ye receive me not;
<note place="margin">John 5.</note> if any come in his own name, him ye will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here we ſee that the deſign and purpoſe of the Devil is to deſtroy not only men, but Chriſt himſelf too, if he could.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee alſo who it was principally that did ſhed the blood of Chriſt, even the Devil himſelf: he could not endure to ſee him on the earth where his Kingdom is. He was afraid he ſhould be thruſt out of his Kingdom. He firſt made uſe of the Council of the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> to bring about this murther and theft: then the malice of the traytor: laſtly, the hands of ſinfull men. But this not without Gods permiſſion, who had decreed from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to redeem mankind by the blood of his innocent ſon.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Obſerve here, that the nature and work of the Devil is to inſpire and ſuggeſt evil; as God by his Spirit doth inſpire good things into the hearts of Believers. An example of the Devils
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:171778:58"/> ſuggeſtion we have in <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 5.</note> That wicked one is accuſtomed to it, and knoweth how to hinder, as much as may be all good, 1
<hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. and to further all evil, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. Know therefore that all offences and ſin come from the Devil, and not from God, as Hereticks teach. The Devil I ſay, inſpired all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from the beginning of the world to diſobey God. What the Devil can do is notoriouſly ſeen in
<hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews.</hi> Him he inſtigated and drew on to betray his own Maſter; them he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed to deſtroy their own Meſſiah and King.</p>
                  <p>Let us pray then that God by his Grace would ſhut and keep all ſuch diabolical inſinuations out of our hearts. For that wicked one will perſwade us to nothing that is good.</p>
                  <p>After this the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> mentioneth the Power and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt, leſt any ſhould think that Chriſt was not God, becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> could betray him. As he was God in the beginning, ſo he continued, even when he was betrayed and crucified.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Again, He ſpeaketh of Chriſts power, that from the commendation of ſo great power and ſublimity, the work of his deep humility might become the more admirable and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. Thus
<hi>Paul</hi> when he was about to extoll the humility and obedience of Chriſt, he begins with his ſublimity,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the form of God,</hi> &amp;c. We can never rightly prize the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation of Chriſt, unleſs withall we conſider his high eſtate. Neither can any man ſo well eſteem of his love, till he conſider upon whom, and to what unworthy perſons he did beſtow it.</p>
                  <p>Now the infinite height of Chriſt is ſet forth in three words.
<note place="margin">1.</note>The firſt is this, Knowing that the Father had given all things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands: or, that he was Lord of all, even of the Devil and wicked men, and yet would as it were lay by this his power for the love he bare to men, or rather would hide it, and ſo become weak and low; ſo weak as not to help the godly, yea ſo low as to ſuffer the wicked to vent their rage upon him without reſtraint: great humiliation indeed, and great love, and all this that he might ſuccour poor helpieſs man.</p>
                  <p>Or thus, knowing that the Father had given him all things into his hands, <hi>i. e.</hi> he knew that the ſalvation of mankind depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him. It was at his pleaſure whether man ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved or periſh. He did know, and indeed acknowledge, that to ſave men was a gift given him of the Father; therefore he doth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:171778:59"/> manfully and couragiouſly ſet about that work. And we have great conſolation from theſe two words, that the Father hath given all things to Chriſt, and that into his hands, to wit, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, forgiveneſs of ſins, Life, Salvation, Redemption, Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Reſurrection, Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereby we alſo are put in mind to know, and give good heed to what God hath given us, what he hath committed or commanded to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>The ſecond word that expreſſeth Chriſts Highneſs, is, that he came out from God. All creatures are from God by creation; but Chriſt came from God by Eternal generation. So that tis all one as if he had ſaid, knowing that he was the natural Son of God, yet for all that he ſo humbled himſelf,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or thus, knowing that he came out from God, that he was the Son of God, and that he was God, therefore he did like a God, and that which did become the Son of God to do, <hi>viz.</hi> take compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhew mercy, do good, waſh, cleanſe, ſave, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> theſe are proper to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>The third word ſhewing Chriſts ſublimity, is, that he goeth to the Father. Here I ſhall uſe the words of
<hi>Auguſtine:</hi> He came out from God, ſaith he, but left not God: He goeth unto God, but he left not us men. The meaning is, he goeth unto God; that is, he was ſure of his glory: however he ſeemed to be caſt off, yet he knew that he ſhould ſit at the right hand of his Father, and there be heard. <hi>Sit thou on my right hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till I make thy foes thy footſtool.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſalm 110.</note> But in the mean while he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth himſelf both to his friends and foes. Let not us be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to do good to all by this Example, inaſmuch as certain glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is therefore promiſed unto us.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> hath propoſed the perſon of Chriſt to our conſideration. Next he deſcribeth the work it ſelf, and ſets it as it were before our eyes, to the end we ſhould do as doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Apoſtles did when they beheld theſe things, to wit, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently attend, admire every paſſage, and expect what the end will be. Surely it is a great and wonderfull ſpectacle, ſuch as never was ſince the world began. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>Maſters uſe not to riſe from Table before their ſervants. But here Chriſt riſeth and leaveth them ſitting, and ſo that is verified which ſaith a little after,
<note place="margin">Luke 22. Matth. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>I am among you as one that ſerveth.</hi> Again, <hi>the ſon of man came not to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:171778:59"/>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>By laying aſide his garments, girding himſelf, and fetching water, he plainly ſheweth that he was ready to ſerve, help, and do good: a matter of greateſt conſolation to us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>He is indeed, and that a moſt humble ſervant too: he kneels down, and begins to waſh not their hands, which had been a neater ſervice, but their feet, which is ſo low and mean an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, that none but the worſt in the houſe doth it. Yet all this he doth himſelf, he only puts forth water, he only waſheth, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he wipeth.</p>
                  <p>Who will not here cry out with the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Hab. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>I heard of thy works, and trembled?</hi> Conſider with your ſelves in good earneſt who Chriſt was, and whoſe feet he waſht. We have heard ſomething already of the worth of Chriſt. But what was more vile than the Apoſtles? They were all poor contemptible men, and one of them was a Traytor, another (afterwards) abjured him, yet for all that he ſerves them moſt affectionately. What can he refuſe to do, who humbled himſelf ſo low for us? Here we ſee indeed that he was <hi>noviſsimui virorum,</hi> rejected of men.
<note place="margin">Iſ. 53.3.</note> Now he doth rather waſh the feet than the hands or head, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would thereby expreſs more humility and love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he waſheth us in his blood.</p>
                  <p>All which are Examples and Precepts to perſwade us to ſerve one another with a ready mind. The Lord of Heaven doth not ſcorn nor bluſh to do that which even Eccleſiaſtical perſons as well as Secular, and worldly Pontentates are aſhamed to do, whoſe duty principally is to imitate the meekneſs and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Primitive Chriſtians were not aſhamed of this ſervice to their brethren, but did it with much cheerfulneſs. Did not that great Patriarch <hi>Abraham</hi> cauſe the feet of his gueſts to be waſhed? So did his couſen <hi>Let, Gen.</hi> 19.
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.</note> In the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this was a work of great account.
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> doth not admit a widow unleſs ſhe had waſhed the Saints feet. But now one may ſooner find, eſpecially among the Prelates of the Church, ſuch as waſh their own feet in wine, rather then give a cup of cold water to a poor body. It is taken for an hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical thing now to waſh others feet. Nothing inveigh'd againſt now more than good works. None reprove ſin: The times are ſuch, that few regard whether they do good or evil. What
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:171778:60"/>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>Wherefore this Act of Chriſt condemneth our pride, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whereof it is, that although we be men, though we be but mortal men, yet we diſdain to ſubmit or give place to others in the ſmalleſt matters: ſo far are we from yielding or doing good to our enemies. This is the pride of mans heart, which Chriſt here utterly condemneth. Let men be aſhamed of their pride, as well they may, when they ſee the Son of God with ſo great humility become a ſervant. Why is earth and aſhes proud? Miſerable worm,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 10.</note> doſt thou yet walk with a ſtretched out neck? look through the ſpectacle of humility. Thy Saviour was ready to ſerve, doſt thou ſeek the preheminence?

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Hereby Chriſt would root all arrogancy out of the hearts of the Apoſtles: which is a peculiar vice to eminent men, and ſuch as are endowed with much Grace, or are in high place and office.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt did indeed riſe from ſupper,
<note place="margin">The Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</note> that is, from his repoſe, from out of his Fathers boſom, from the Throne of boundleſs Majeſty. And for no other end but for the oppreſſion of the poor and deep ſighing of the needy, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 12.15.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He laid aſide the garments of glory, and ſtript himſelf na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked of all righteouſneſſes, and whatever he had of worth; a Glory,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> Fame, Name, Power, he emptied himſelf of that <hi>bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> which he had before the world was, <hi>John</hi> 17. So that he
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:171778:60"/> ſeemed naked, <hi>i. e.</hi> in all things like unto us. Hence it is, that as wicked <hi>Cham</hi> heretofore mocked his naked Father, ſo not only the <hi>Jews,</hi> but moſt falſe Chriſtians too, have jeered this humiliation of Chriſt, and alwayes denyed that he was God begotten of God, and affirmed that he was only man, and had his being from <hi>Mary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. He girded himſelf with a white Towel, <hi>i. e.</hi> with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maculate body, and uncorrupt humane nature, which like a white Towel, was not only clean in it ſelf, but alſo wiped away our ſpots, and made us clean alſo. Or thus, he girded himſelf with a Towel,
<hi>i. e.</hi> with the anguiſh of his Paſſion and Death: and ſo as he had begun magnificently to ſhew his charity, he did more magnificently finiſh it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Then he poureth water into a Baſon, <hi>i.e.</hi> he poured out the Holy Spirit upon the Believers,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.</note> which by his Paſſion he merited for them; which Spirit in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is called <hi>clean water, I will pour clean water upon you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or,</p>
                  <p>He poured water into a Baſon, <hi>i. e.</hi> he opened our wits to underſtand the Scriptures. That water was in a pot before: the Scripture was ſhut up, the Book was ſealed, the Myſteries of God were hidden, the face of <hi>Moſes</hi> was vailed. But now Chriſt hath poured forth the water into a Baſon, <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath revealed the hid things of the Scriptures for the Salvation of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers. From that time Chriſt began to waſh us. I ſay, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: for he hath not made an end yet; but doth daily waſh, and wipe us with his Towel, <hi>i. e.</hi> the merit of his Paſſion. So that from hence we may underſtand not only the love of Chriſt, but our own miſery alſo. For it muſt be great filthineſs which none but the Son of God could wipe away, and that not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his death and blood. By this tis plain that man had deeply fallen, becauſe we ſee the Son of God deſcend and humble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo low.</p>
                  <p>Paſtors of the Church ſhould follow this Example of Chriſt, Let them watch and ariſe, and make ready to Miniſter. Throw all away that hindereth the work, whatever it be. Let them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the dark Myſteries of the Scriptures to others. Let them waſh others, but ſo, as they themſeves be girt with a Towel; leſt while they make others clean, themſelves be defiled.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>There are ſome that think Chriſt began with
<hi>Judas,</hi> and ſo went upward till at laſt he came to <hi>Peter.</hi> But others reject this opinion upon this ground, that although <hi>Judas</hi> had patience, and with a brazen face held out till Chriſt had done this to him, yet the other Diſciples could not hold their peace.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt probable that he began at <hi>Peter,</hi> who was firſt among the Apoſtles, not by Vocation (for <hi>Andrew</hi> followed Chriſt before him) but by Election unto the Apoſtleſhip, for there
<hi>Peter</hi> is put in the firſt place.
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> And twas very proper in this waſhing to begin with the chiefeſt. For where the Paſtor or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late is unclean in Doctrine or life, thoſe that are under their charge will quickly be defiled: and how ſhall ſuch a man make others clean who is ſo filthy himſelf? If the ſalt hath loſt its ſalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how ſhall it ſeaſon other things?</p>
                  <p>Nor is it without a Myſterie that the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> doth not call <hi>Peter</hi> only by that name which Chriſt gave, but by that alſo which he had before. <hi>He cometh,</hi> ſaith he, to <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down his old name firſt. <hi>Peter,</hi> as we ſhall ſee anon, did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in himſelf the nature both of fleſh and faith: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is called by divers names. In the diſcourſe of Chriſt
<hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh three times, but all differently. Firſt, out of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Secondly, out of obſtinacy. Thirdly, in Faith. And Chriſt doth thrice anſwer him. Firſt, he inſtructeth his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Secondly, he reproveth and repelleth his ſtubbornneſs. Thirdly, he commendeth his Faith. And ſo we ſpeak to God, and he to us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whereas <hi>Peter</hi> firſt ſaith by way of queſtion,
<note place="margin">Firſt word.</note> 
                     <hi>Lord, doeſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:171778:61"/> thou waſh my feet?</hi> Tis plain that he ſtood amazed at ſo great a condeſcention of his Lord. And no marvel; for the reſt would have done ſo too, if he had begun with them. Yea, who could but admire to ſee the Lord of Majeſty became ſo humble a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant unto men?
<note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> Its a ſign of a godly ſoul to admire and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the works of God. Thus <hi>Moſes,</hi> although he preſt to ſee why the buſh was not burnt: yet when he heard God ſpeak out of the buſh, he durſt not approach.
<note place="margin">Gen. 28</note> So <hi>Jacob</hi> when he had ſeen a Ladder in his dream, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he awaked as one in a trance, and ſo great a vouchſafement of God: <hi>How terrible</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>is this place!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If we conſider this word of <hi>Peter,</hi> we ſhall ſee that he had ſeveral reſpects, partly good, partly imperfect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt, He had reſpect to that excellent dignity of his Lord, when he ſaid, <hi>doſt thou Lord?</hi> I ſay, he conſidered what a baſe employment it was to waſh feet, becauſe the feet are the loweſt, and ſo the meaneſt members, not named without <hi>ſaving your preſence.</hi> He thought it a great diſparagement, that thoſe hands which had wrought ſo many Miracles among the people ſhould now waſh his feet: and this was good in him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>On the other hand he conſidered his own unworthineſs, when he ſaid, for Me, or my feet? and that alſo was commendable. From both which he infer'd, that 'twas more fit for him to ſerve Chriſt, than for Chriſt to ſerve him, which alſo is praiſe-worthy. We muſt needs acknowledge that God is nothing indebted to us, but we much to him. Lord, doſt thou waſh my feet? thou Lord of Majeſtie, for me the vileſt of creatures? a wretched ſinner? But <hi>Peter</hi> was miſtaken to think it a diſhonourable thing for Chriſt to ſerve us; as ſome now adayes think it a diſhonour and diſgrace to Chriſt to give us his body to eat, whereas it is his greateſt glory. For hereby his infinite love and mercy doth per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſhine upon us.</p>
                  <p>But the nature of our fleſh is ſuch, that it hath no fear of God at all when it ſinneth; but when it ſhould pray for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, it would ſeem to have ſuch reverence, that it confeſſeth it ſelf to be ſo unworthy, that it dare not come nigh him. So <hi>Peter</hi> ſeems here to have great reverence of Chriſt, but by and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies him in a fearleſs manner: and ſo do we. Again, herein alſo <hi>Peter</hi> erred, that under pretence of reverence to Chriſt, he puts
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:171778:62"/> off and refuſeth his Miniſtry, as another time upon the ſame ground he thruſt Chriſt from him, when he ſaid. <hi>Depart from me,
<note place="margin">Luke 5.</note> for I am a ſinful man, O Lord.</hi> Nay, rather if thou art a ſinner, thou ſhouldeſt deſire that the Lord would not depart from thee. It hath indeed a ſhew of reverence, but tis very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous, ariſing only from the carnal mind, as moſt think, that by reaſon of their unworthineſs they ſhould diſhonour God if they pray to him or receive the Sacrament. But faith is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind, and thinketh that he diſhonoureth God that ſinneth, not he that begs pardon, and uſeth ſuch remedies againſt ſin as God hath appointed. He that ſubmitteth to the work and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of God, doth not diſhonour him, but he that reſiſteth the ſame, and preferreth his own wit before the will of God.</p>
                  <p>It is ſurely a great part of Piety to acknowledge our unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs, and ſo we ought to do. It is alſo a pious part to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Gods Majeſty. But this piety will run into ſuperſtition, if we reject Chriſts Miniſtry, becauſe of our unworthineſs. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no cauſe why we ſhould be afraid to draw near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, inaſmuch as he himſelf commandeth us to come unto him and call upon him. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Caell upon me in the day of trouble,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> &amp;c. Pſalm 50. Thou canſt not honour God more then to pray unto him faithfully: and thou caſteſt the greateſt ſcorn and contempt upon him that may be, if thou ſlighteſt him by not coming when he calleth and promiſeth his aſſiſtance. Thou canſt not attribute more honour to Chriſt than by bearing and ſuffering his work to be done in thee. Hence <hi>Mary</hi> who ſat ſtill at the feet of Jeſus, and hearkened to Chriſts Miniſtry when he preached, had a much more honourable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation than buſie
<hi>Martha.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 10.</note> In ſhort, if thou deſireſt thy health, thou muſt not drive the Phyſitian from thee. Rather come with the more boldneſs, the more frail and unworthy thou art; as in outward neceſſities, we do not regard our own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, or the worthineſs of others ſo long as they help us and do us good. As a hunger-ſtarv'd man is not aſhamed or afraid to beg of the moſt noble Perſonage, his neceſſity compels him: Go thou and do likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Second word.</note>The ſecond time
<hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks more ſawſily, with a ſhew of zeal indeed, but not according to knowledge. <hi>Thou,</hi> ſaith he, ſhalt <hi>never</hi> waſh my feet. And here again is the nature of fleſh
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:171778:62"/> diſcovered, which is alwayes obſtinate in its own (as it thinks) good purpoſe, and under a fair pretence ſtifly maintains its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited opinion, whether in jeſt or earneſt, whereof Chriſt moſt holily inſtructed <hi>Peter,</hi> but all in vain.</p>
                  <p>The like obſtinacy we ſee in <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Chron 21.</note> when he was diſſwaded from numbring the people. And in <hi>Joſia</hi> when he was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to war againſt the King of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Chron. 35.</note> Therefore the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>There is a way which ſeemeth right unto a man:
<note place="margin">Prov. 14.</note> but the end thereof are the wayes of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Peter</hi> is a figure of thoſe who pleaſe themſelves only with what ſeems to be good to them, and which they do with their good meanings, as they call them. But tis not enough to do what ſeems good to us, unleſs God alſo approve of it. For moſt commonly ſo it falls out, that what we think to be good, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo:
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 23 1 Sam. 15.</note> as when
<hi>Saul</hi> in ſacrificing would needs uſurp the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Prieſt. So when he reſerved the cattel taken from the <hi>Amalechites</hi> for ſacrifice. So that tis not enough to have a good meaning, but chiefly to conſider what the will of God is: elſe they that perſecute Chriſtians may be excuſed,
<note place="margin">John 16.</note> for they did it with a good meaning, thinking they did God ſervice thereby.</p>
                  <p>But here Chriſt firſt reproveth <hi>Peters</hi> ignorance, ſaying, <hi>What I do thou knoweſt not now; but thou ſhalt know hereafter.</hi> As much as to ſay, why doeſt thou withſtand me, ſeeing thou knoweſt not why or wherefore I do this? What I do is no trifle, though thou doſt not underſtand.
<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> So he ſaid to
<hi>John</hi> when he was afraid to baptize him: <hi>Suffer it to be ſo now, for thus it becometh us to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill all righteouſneſs.</hi> Indeed
<hi>Peter</hi> knew not what Chriſt did then. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He thought his Lord did that ſervice for ſome bodily Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, as others uſed to do.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He did not yet fully underſtand the Diſcipline of this his Maſter, that he that would be greateſt in his School, muſt be as the leaſt: and ſpecially that the great Lord of all would raign in the higheſt Tower of Humility: of which we ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak hereafter,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> concerning the ſtrife among the Apoſtles for Precedency, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Peter</hi> knew not whereto this his pertinacy and diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly reſpect would come in the end, he little thought the iſſue of it would be his ſelf-juſtification. He that will not let Chriſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:171778:63"/> waſh him, what elſe doth he pretend, but that he is righteous enough, and hath no need of the Grace of God?
<hi>Peter</hi> did not conſider this, that his words tended to ſuch a thing; otherwiſe he would not have refuſed.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt yet doth not preſently tell him the reaſon of this waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
<note place="margin">Eccl. 3.</note> For there is a time to work, and a time to ſpeak: we ſhould obſerve God in both. But tells him he ſhall know hereafter: for by and by after he ſat down again, he explained this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to them. And then this humility of Chriſt took ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in <hi>Peter,</hi> that he afterward exhorts others thereunto.
<hi>Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.</note> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Hence we alſo my learn, not raſhly to require a reaſon of Gods works, but humbly to obey his will. What is here ſaid to
<hi>Peter,</hi> is ſpoken to us all. For certainly we are ignorant, and know not that God now worketh in us, with us, for us. He waſheth us ſometimes with proſperity, ſometimes with adverſity; but we underſtand it not. But we ſhall know hereafter, when we are enlightened by the Spirit of God, but ſpecially in the world to come.</p>
                  <p>Thus of the anſwer to <hi>Peters</hi> firſt word. To his pertinacy he hath a ſharper anſwer:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, if thou ſtriveſt for the preheminence, and wilt not ſubmit thy ſelf to me, thou canſt not be my Diſciple. Chriſts ſchool will have ſuch ſchollars who reſign their own will, mortifie their own reaſon,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.</note> and lead all their underſtanding captive into the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus he that would not be pacified with a promiſe, is quieted with a threatning. It is indeed a great commination to ſay, Thou ſhalt have no part with me. Not to have part with Chriſt, is to have our part with the Devil and all wicked men. As there is nothing better can befall a man than to have his part with Chriſt, ſo not to partake with him is unavoidable damnation.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, let's do and ſuffer whatever is required of us to do and ſuffer, leſt we loſe this our ſhare with Chriſt. To have part with Chriſt, is to partake of his Grace, Spirit, and Word here; and of his Glory and Kingdom hereafter. This part <hi>Peter</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward denied to
<hi>Simon Magus;
<note place="margin">Acts 8.</note> Thou haſt no part nor lot in this word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:171778:63"/> But this word of Chriſt may have another meaning: <hi>If I waſh thee not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q.d.</hi> Why art thou afraid at my meek manner of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour, and ſtartleſt at this kind of Miniſtry? wilt not thou that I waſh thee with water, when thou muſt of neceſſity be waſhed with my blood? except I gird my ſelf harder yet, and waſh thee with greater labour and pains, thou wilt have no part with me. Truly if Chriſt had not waſhed his Elect with his blood, neither
<hi>Peter</hi> nor any man elſe could have had any part with him.</p>
                  <p>So is it ſtill, whom Chriſt purgeth not, he is yet unclean: as it was heretofore, no man was clean till he was waſhed with the water of Purification.
<note place="margin">Numb. 19. Apoc. 21.</note> And no unclean thing ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Chriſt: therefore it is rightly ſaid, if I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me.</p>
                  <p>By all this Chriſt ſheweth what is meant by the waſhing of feet, and why he did waſh his Diſciples feet before his Paſſion. Teaching us hereby, that it is his office only to purge and waſh away the filth of ſin: which he doth by the ſprinkling of his blood.</p>
                  <p>This waſhing then of the feet ſignifieth the whole Paſſion of Chriſt, who miniſtred to us, and waſhed us. Where note, that none is purged from ſin but by Chriſt. Alſo ſee here our lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who hear that we ſhall have no part with Chriſt except he waſh us, yet we run not to him, though he be preſent with us.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs <hi>Peter</hi> wholly ſubmitted himſelf to Chriſt, being terrified with this his threatning word: <hi>Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>not only my feet, but alſo my hands and my head.</hi> As if he had ſaid, if it be ſo, there's an end, I have done; not my will, but thine be done; I will no longer hinder thee from waſhing me. Only let me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be ſeparated from thee. Lo, I preſent my hands, feet, head, my whole body: waſh me, wipe me, do as thou wilt, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſay againſt it. At firſt I did not know what it meant, therefore I crave pardon, I cry thee mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith of him:
<hi>Peter</hi> was earneſt in denying, more earneſt in yielding, both proceeded from love.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>Here we ſee the nature of Faith, which fully and wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth it ſelf unto the will of God, to do with us whatſoever he pleaſeth. Come life, come death, all as he will. So
<hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.26.</note> if he ſay, I have no delight in thee: behold, here am I, let him do to
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:171778:64"/> me as ſeemeth good to him.
<note place="margin">Gen. 12.</note> And ſo <hi>Abraham,</hi> he fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to God, following him whitherſoever he led him. This Reſignation of ſelf unto the will of God is a moſt accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſervice to him: As Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he that will come after me, let him deny himſelf and follow me.</hi>

                     <hi>Behold, I was conceived in iniquities, ſprinkle me with Hyſop,</hi> &amp;c. To be ſhort, This word of <hi>Peter</hi> ſheweth that we are wholly polluted in body and ſoul, in affections, works, intention, will and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. So that we have very great need of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>Hence we learn what we have moſt need to ask of Chriſt, even that he would cleanſe us every whit, who created us all that we are. If we be not firſt purified, we can never partake of the good things of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4.</note>Laſtly, He ſheweth what we ſhould principally offer to God for his innumerable benefits, even an univerſal Reſignation, not only of our temporal goods, but of our own will and reaſon too: that with <hi>David</hi> we might ſay twice,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 108.</note> 
                     <hi>O God, my heart is ready, my heart is ready.</hi> Ready to deny the world for thy ſake: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, ready to deny my ſelf for thee. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> not only left his Country at Gods call;
<note place="margin">Gen. 12.22.</note> but was ready to ſlay his ſon too at his command. But there are too few now that imitate him. Perhaps there be ſome that will part with a little traſh; but very rarely ſhall we find one that will ſtrangle his own will.</p>
                  <p>Although <hi>Peter</hi> preſented his hands and his head to be waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet Chriſt waſheth only his feet, with which he began at firſt. <hi>For he that is waſhed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>needeth not ſave to waſh his feet.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>Peter,</hi> I need not waſh thy hands and head; theſe are clean enough already, but thy feet can never be waſht too much: for they will preſently be foul again. See how fitly Chriſt turneth his ſpeech from outward things to ſpiritual. From waſhing the members of the body, he paſſeth on to the waſhing of the inward parts of the ſoul it ſelf, which are the affections, here meant by the feet.</p>
                  <p>As in every employment the feet tread on the ground, ſo this our mortal life cannot continue without our affections. The af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:171778:64"/> interpoſe themſelves in all buſineſſes; ſo that if any ſhall ſay, they need not waſhing and cleanſing, he is altogether mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken. <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves,
<note place="margin">1 John 1.</note> and the truth is not in us.</hi> He waſheth our feet daily, who maketh interceſſion for us in Heaven continually. That we have need of this daily waſhing we acknowledge when we pray,
<note place="margin">Matth 6.</note> 
                     <hi>forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> &amp;c. Now Chriſt in ſaying [<hi>He that is waſhed</hi> &amp;c.] plainly ſheweth that we need a two-fold waſhing.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The firſt is when the whole body is waſhed, the inbred pollution: the other when the feet are cleanſed from that duſt and dirt which daily cleaveth to them. Chriſt by his blood hath waſhed us both theſe wayes. Firſt at the Font, where the whole man is waſhed from his inbred uncleanneſs, his original ſin. This is done, and that but once, at the Font. Wherefore he ſaith, He that is waſhed, needeth not <hi>So</hi> to be waſht again in Baptiſm. Once Baptized is ſufficient: Only we muſt have a care to waſh our feet often. And,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſecond Baptiſm is not in the Font, but in
<hi>Podoniptro,</hi> in true Repentance, which purgeth our daily ſins. There is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Table in which they may eſcape by ſwimming, who have made Ship-wrack after the firſt waſhing. This is the waſhing of which
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaketh: <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Iſ. 1.</note> This waſhing of the feet by Repentance ſhould never be omitted. For the way we go (as the vulg. Lat. hath it) is polluted, ſaith <hi>David.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That which Chriſt addeth is enough to melt and move any man:
<hi>But is clean every whit.</hi> How is he every whit clean that muſt yet waſh his feet?

                  </p>
                  <p>It is moſt true that there is no man without ſin: yet withall tis as true, that whoſoever is purified by Faith is clean every whit. He that is planted into the body of Chriſt doth partake of and poſſeſs by faith the holineſs and purity of Chriſt. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith to Believers: <hi>Ye are waſhed,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6. Rom. 8.</note> ye are ſanctified by the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Again, <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Thoſe that be planted into Chriſt are called
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:171778:65"/> holy by Faith, the Name and Blood of Chriſt. But yet in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves they are nothing but ſinners, and have yet many ſins, but no condemnation: for God accounteth of them as clean by Faith in Chriſt. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf, <hi>With my mind I ſerve the Law of God,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> but with my fleſh the law of ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hence we conclude, that the Apoſtles were baptized: otherwiſe he would not have ſaid to them, he needeth not ſave to waſh his feet.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Baptiſm is not ſufficient, except alſo we waſh our feet.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Grace is of more force than ſin. Where Grace is, a man is accounted juſt and pure before God, notwithſtanding he be not yet altogether without ſin and imperfections in himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Repentance is neceſſary to backſliders.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That common cleanneſs by baptiſm, and the profeſſion of the Faith of the Goſpel is not ſufficient for a Goſpel-Miniſter, except his feet, the affections of his ſoul alſo be purged from all the filth of this world, from which a man ſhall find it a hard matter to keep himſelf pure, unleſs he be ſtill carefull to waſh off the pollution contracted by converſe with men, with the blood of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto Chriſt ſpake in general, <hi>He that is waſhed,</hi> &amp;c. But preſently he directeth his ſpeech to the Apoſtles in ſpecial: And <hi>ye,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are clean, but not all.</hi> The Apoſtles were clean becauſe baptized, and cleaving cloſe to Chriſt, becauſe they lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and followed him with unwearied deſire. But above all they were clean from the impiety and covetouſneſs of the traytor
<hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das.</hi> It ſoundeth ſweetly when the Judge himſelf ſhall pronounce us guiltleſs.</p>
                  <p>But that which follows, is full of terrour; <hi>But not all:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt doth not only ſmite <hi>Judas,</hi> but alſo all ſuch that live wickedly in the profeſſion of Chriſtianity. For all is not Gold that gliſters. <hi>Judas</hi> had his feet outwardly waſhed, and kept company with the Apoſtles: he was with them in the body, but not in the Faith. Therefore he was caſt with his filthy hands and feet into utter darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo Emphatically added by <hi>John: For he knew who it was that ſhould betray him:</hi> to let us know that Chriſt ſaid this for <hi>Judas</hi> ſake only, <hi>ye are not all clean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Hereby he giveth us an Example of true charity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:171778:65"/> Chriſt ſaw the very heart of this wicked man: he knew his bloody deſign, yet he gave him like reſpect with others, and waſht his feet as well as the reſt. Hence learn to love your enemies, and do good to them that hate you. This wonderfull and abſolute clemency is proper only to the nature of our Lord. Although he knoweth our ſins, yet doth he not preſently puniſh us: but many wayes recalleth us in his long-ſuffering patience. Oft-times doth he good to his rebellious Traytors, to make that good which he ſaith by the Prophet,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>I will not the death of a ſinner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſetteth forth the greatneſs of <hi>Judas</hi> his ſin, which Chriſt could not waſh away, becauſe that wicked man reſiſted and withſtood the ſame. We admire at ſome mens ſins, and begin to examine their weight and hainous nature, in that the Prophets could not cure them, though they applied never ſo many Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, as one of them complaineth:
<note place="margin">Jer. 51.</note> 
                     <hi>We would have healed</hi> Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, <hi>and ſhe is not healed.</hi> How great then was

                  <p>
                     <hi>So after he had waſhed their feet, and had taken his garments,

                  </p>
                  <p>Here Chriſt performed what he had before promiſe, to
<hi>Peter</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:171778:66"/> when he waſht his feet. <hi>Thou ſhalt know it afterward.</hi> Now he ſhews him what this waſhing of the feet did ſignifie. Thus every thing is to be done in its ſeaſon. Let the work be firſt done in it ſelf, then let the expoſition and interpretation of it follow what is meant by it. Chriſt did not preſently tell them the ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this waſhing, that the Diſciples might the more diligently attend, and the more admire it before they knew it, or the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it. Now be layeth by the Baſon and Towel, and ſits down again, and ſetleth himſelf to preach to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>And firſt he prepares their attention by an interrogation: for when we are askt what we know not, we are as it were jogg'd to liſten more attentively. So Chriſt here: <hi>Know ye what I have done to you?</hi> Doubtleſs they did not know. They knew their feet were waſht, but why, or wherefore, they were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant. This then they had need to be inſtructed in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Let us all in general ſuppoſe that it is ſaid to us: <hi>Know ye what I have done for ye?</hi> Whereby we ſhould be ſtirred up to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on what the Lord hath beſtowed upon us. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We have received the Spirit of God,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.</note> that we may know the things which God hath freely given unto us.</hi> Thus Chriſt ſaith to every Believer; knoweſt thou what I have done for thee by Creation, by Redemption, by calling thee in particular? This is that great and higheſt Knowledge of all, which keeps us from being pufft up, and alone commendeth us to God. It is the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary of all: for we may be ignorant of all other knowledge without any danger, but not of this. If any be ignorant, let him be ignorant.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.38.</note> But let us return to the words of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Before he expreſſeth his meaning by waſhing their feet, he firſt premiſeth his own Dignity and Honour, the more forcibly to draw them to his imitation, ſeeing his Dignity on one hand, and their own confuſion on the other, if they did not imitate him. The actions of great perſons moſt move to imitation, and make mean men aſhamed if they do not ſo too. <hi>Ye call me Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Lord,</hi> ſaith he. Chriſt might have ſpoken more and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things of his worth &amp; dignity, but he contented himſelf with thoſe Titles which the Apoſtles gave him: Nor need he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on more. For if it be an honour for a Schollar to follow his Maſter, who is but a man: what great ſhame is it for a Chriſtian to be proud when he ſees God humble himſelf?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:171778:66"/> He ſaith Emphatically, Ye call me
<hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Lord.</hi> For the <hi>Phariſees</hi> alſo call'd him Maſter very often, with the mouth on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but not from the heart.
<note place="margin">Matth. 22. Luke 10.</note> So ſome of them call'd him Maſter only, but not Lord: for they never intended to yield obedience to him. Yet there were of them call'd him Lord too, but they heard him reply, Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I ſay? It was then no ſmall commendation to the Apoſtles that he ſaith to them,
<hi>Ye call me Maſter and Lord;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 6.46. 1 Cor. 12.</note> for as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>No man can ſay that Jeſus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The Apoſtles call'd Chriſt Maſter, becauſe they deſired to learn of him; and Lord, becauſe they were willing to obey him. Therefore he ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye ſay well.</hi> They only do truly call God Father who love and reverence him: And they only rightly call him Lord who fear him, as it is ſaid, <hi>if I be your Father, where is mine honour?
<note place="margin">Mal. 1.</note> if I be a Maſter, where is my fear?</hi> And that men ſhould not think that Chriſt had theſe two Titles of Maſter and Lord from men only, and not of his proper right, he addeth, <hi>And ye ſay well, for ſo I am.</hi> There are many called of men Maſters and Lords, who know little, and lack much. But Chriſt is moſt truly a Maſter and a Lord. He received thoſe titles from no man, but had them naturally of himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He is truly Lord of All, he hath dominion over all men, whoſe right it is for all to ſerve him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He is truly a Maſter. He teacheth outwardly, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but ſpiritually and inwardly enlighteneth, becauſe he is the wiſdom of the Father.</p>
                  <p>And even as he being the Life, quickeneth all things that are capable of life, ſo being the wiſdom of the Father, infuſeth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into all that will receive him; which no man or Angel can do. Therefore it is well ſaid, <hi>One is your Maſter, even Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mark the ſtrength of the Argument, <hi>If I the Lord and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have waſhed your feet, ye alſo ought to waſh one another feet.</hi> The meaning is, if I am a Lord, you by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence muſt be ſervants. Whence it might further be inferred, that I ought not to waſh your feet, but you rather ſhould waſh my feet. But tis not without cauſe that I have inverted this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom. My intent hereby is to teach you charity and humility, which I could not ſufficiently inculcate with words, nor ſo effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:171778:67"/> faſten on you, I have choſen to work upon by my own Example. Now if I have not diſdained to ſerve you in ſo mean a way, no more ſhould you ſcorn to do the like to others.</p>
                  <p>There is ſurely a great difference between me and you. I am God, you are but men. There's little difference between you and other men, but a titular difference only. One is call'd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, another ſervant, but by nature they are equal, and both alike miſerable. I therefore who am ſo much greater than any man, have given you an Example, that it ſhould not be irkſome to you to do the like to your equals, which I a Maſter and a Lord have done to you that are but Diſciples and ſervants. Let the brother bluſh to over-top the brother, and the ſervant be aſhamed to domineer over his fellow-ſervant, when I who might juſtly claim the height of this dignity to my ſelf, do yet abaſe my ſelf even to waſh your feet.</p>
                  <p>See how modeſtly Chriſt ſpeaks theſe things. As in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent part he mentioned his own Properties, to wit, <hi>I your Lord and Maſter:</hi> ſo in the Conſequent clauſe he might have caſt them in the teeth with their former ſtate and condition, Ye men, ſervants and ſinners. But he ſaith no more but this, <hi>Ye alſo ought,</hi> &amp;c. Hereby teaching us, ſo to commend our ſelves (where the caſe ſo requireth) that we detract not from others, nor ſwell with pride againſt others though we be greater than they.</p>
                  <p>This is that which Chriſt requireth of his Apoſtles, and of all others who acknowledge him a Maſter and a Lord, even to waſh one anothers feet. None is exempted from it, of what ſtate or condition ſoever he be. But we muſt not underſtand it of waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bodily feet only, as though that were ſtill neceſſary in every reſpect; for ſo they that follow not Chriſt at all may waſh the feet of others, though they Lord it over them with never ſo much pride. Now therefore,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If we refer the waſhing of feet to the Apoſtles, it enjoyns them ſo to exerciſe their Miniſtry, that they know and really ſet forth to the view of all, that they are not Lords over others, but ſervants and Miniſters to them, and that they exerciſe their office for the benefit and good of men, not with haughtineſs and contempt: that they prove it with pains and diligence, and not maintain their authority by violence and force, but with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:171778:67"/> modeſty and edification, as Chriſt teacheth,
<note place="margin">Matth. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>He that is greateſt among you, let him be your Miniſter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. But if we refer this word of Chriſt to all Chriſtians in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, then to waſh the feet is nothing elſe but to prefer others before himſelf, to ſerve others, or as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>to bear their burdens, and pleaſe others rather than himſelf.</hi> Here then all our ambition, which is wonderfull great, is condemned.</p>
                  <p>Before Chriſt teacheth them peace and charity, he firſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to root ambition and the thirſt of glory out of their minds. Where ambition is,
<note place="margin">Prov. 13.</note> there even brethren fall together by the ears. Proud men are ever quarrelling. Never any thing ſo rent Chriſtian unity in pieces like ambition, when one will not yield to another.</p>
                  <p>The Words of Chriſt carry an Emphaſis in them: <hi>And ye ought,</hi> &amp;c. to let us know that tis not ſo much his Counſell, as his Command, which muſt not be ſleighted: and that we ſhall incur great puniſhment if we obey it not. Therefore he addeth, <hi>I have given you an Example,</hi> &amp;c. And truly a very excellent one, worthy of all diligence. Chriſt was Lord not only of men, but Angels too,
<note place="margin">Matth. 11. &amp; 28.</note> to whom the Father had given to ſhare with him in all things, who had all Power in Heaven and in Earth, who was one with the Father, yet ſo he humbled himſelf,
<note place="margin">John 14.</note> even to the feet of fiſhers. Who ever heard the like of any of the Kings and Princes of this world? So great a price did the Son of God ſet upon us. Let us then do the ſame. Let us walk humbly towards one another. Let us love one another. If this Pattern of Chriſt will not work upon us, nothing will do us good. He muſt needs be obſtinate and obdurate, nay both blinded and deſperate that is not ſoftened with this Example of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Here let thy diſdain, proud man, be confounded, who art ſo proud thou canſt not tell whether thou goeſt on thy head or feet; thou knoweſt not what cloaths to wear, or how to jett it out in thy geſture. Doeſt thou not ſee Chriſt girt, and going up and down among them ſerving with a Baſon and water? And who or what art thou to him? Bluſh for ſhame, wretched man; ſaith he, I have given you an Example; I mean you Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Theſe things were not done and written for Turks, but for us.</p>
                  <p>Whence comes ſo much pride, ſo much loftineſs, ſo much

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:171778:68"/> pomp and ſtate, not only among Lay-Chriſtians, but even among the Biſhops themſelves, the ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles? Is this to imitate Chriſt? What Chriſt by all means endeavoured to prevent, to wit, ambition, pride, pomp, eſpecially in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Church, this very thing is now grown to the height, to the great prejudice and ſcandal of the Church,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us take heed then to this word of Chriſt, <hi>I have given you an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> &amp;c. In this ſpeech Chriſt is to be conſidered two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As our Miniſter, and as a gift given us of God. For he did not only give him <hi>for</hi> us, but he gave him alſo <hi>to</hi> us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.
<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. Matth. 11.</note> As our Example. Thus <hi>Peter, Chriſt hath ſuffered, leaving us an Example.</hi> And Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>Learn of me, for I am meek,</hi> &amp;c. So alſo are all Chriſts works and ſufferings.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They are the Miniſtries wherewith Chriſt miniſtred unto us, they are the very gifts which he gave us. For whatſoever he did and ſuffered, he did it and ſuffered it for us: and ſo he mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred unto us, yea he hath given, and by Faith ſtill doth give all his works and merits to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What he did and ſuffered are our Examples, to which we ought to conform, as here you expreſly hear it. They ſee but with one eye, who reſpect Chriſt but only as a gift, or only as an Example, when his will is that we ſhould conſider him both wayes.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he addeth, <hi>As I have done, ſo do ye,</hi> we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it according to our ability. For there is no man that can do every way as Chriſt did: nor doth Chriſt require it at our hands. As a Maſter ſets his ſcholar a fair Copy that he ſhould imitate his hand to the utmoſt; yet doth he not require or expect that he ſhould at firſt eſſay write as well as he; for he knows it cannot be.</p>
                  <p>This Word [<hi>As I have done</hi>] may be refer'd eſpecially to thoſe things which we have heard, that Chriſt did when he waſht their feet. For herein, if we diligently mark it, is the office of the Apoſtles clearly expreſt.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ought by Chriſts example to riſe from the ſupper of <hi>Moſes</hi> to the ſupper of Chriſt, from knowledge to practice, from meat to labour, from letter to Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They ſhould lay by their garments, caſt aſide whatever hindereth godlineſs, and not be ſlothfull but ſerious in buſineſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="85" facs="tcp:171778:68"/> 3. Gird themſelves with a white Towel, with a pure Life, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that, <hi>Let your loines be girt,</hi> Luke
12.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Gird themſelves, leſt while they cleanſe others, they pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute themſelves.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They muſt pour water out of the pitcher into the Baſon, draw and pour forth the water of ſaving Knowledge out of the Bark of Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Then preſently waſh, but ſpecially the feet, firſt mend the heart and affections.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Wipe with Linnen, build them up whom they have waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their own wholſome and clean converſation: and what they cannot do by words, let them effect with works and an exemplary Life.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. When they have ſo done, let them retire to a private ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and look to their own ſalvation,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>leſt when they have preached to others, they themſelves become caſt-awayes.</hi> The like let other Chriſtians do for themſelves and thoſe committed to them.</p>
                  <p>Now to make this his Example of more force to perſwade, Chriſt uſeth another Argument; <hi>The ſervant,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not greater then his Lord,</hi> q.d. There's no reaſon why ye ſhould be aſhamed to follow my Example; For what are ye but my Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and ſervants, whoſe Lord and Maſter I am? You are not above me: And if hereafter, either you, or your Succeſſors ſhall riſe to any preferment, yet ye will not then be greater, or know and do more than I have done and known. There is no cauſe therefore why you ſhould bluſh at humility and charity who are but ſervants, whereof I your Lord have not been aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>So then Chriſt doth here beat down all proud and ambitious Church-men, let them be either Popes, or Biſhops, or Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, or Doctors;
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> What are they, but ſervants? And if they are ſervants, as all will eaſily confeſs, they ſhould ſo do, as not to climb above their Lord. How this may be, let them well conſider, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I have not time now to pluck up this ſtinking weed. Their own conſcience will tell them wherein they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Chriſt: yea wherein they ſtrive to be above Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Chriſt doth often inculcate this ſaying,
<note place="margin">Mat. 10. &amp; Luke 6.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſervant is not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> &amp;c. But here he rehearſeth it with great weight of words: <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you,</hi> &amp;c. Every body knows that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is not greater than his Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:171778:69"/> But every word of Chriſt, though he doth not ſwear it, is more ſtedfaſt than Heaven and earth,
<note place="margin">Luke 21.</note> as himſelf ſaith,
<hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but my words ſhall not paſs away;</hi> yet here he binds it with an oath; Firſt to make the deeper impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Secondly, to ſhew that it is eaſie to know, but hard to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, and hardeſt of all to obſerve and hold it faſt, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant is not greater than his Lord, neither ſhould be.</p>
                  <p>In outwards none will preſume to go before his Lord, or fare better than he. But in ſpiritual things we ſee it far otherwiſe; Every man coveteth and deſireth to be in a better condition than Chriſt. For though Chriſt was in the form of God, yet he hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf: we that are but wretched creatures run away from humility. Chriſt ſerved us ſervants, we ſcorn to ſerve any man or miniſter to him. Chriſt did good to his enemies, we will not to our brethren: Chriſt was obedient and took pains, we love our eaſe: Chriſt patiently bare the reproaches of men, though he was the brightneſs of the Fathers Glory; we behave our ſelves far otherwiſe. Chriſt the Judge of all men ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be judged, we diſdain that any ſhould judge or reprove us. Chriſt entered into his Glory by the Croſs and death, we think to get thither by luxury and laſciviouſneſs. What elſe do we but prefer our ſelves before our Lord, and covet better things then he enjoyed? Tis not without cauſe, you ſee, that he doth ſo oft and ſo earneſtly preſs this word upon us. For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He would have us take our ſelves for ſervants. And ſecondly, to conſider and think upon what he hath done and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us. He that doth ſeriouſly mind theſe things will be moſt forward to all good, and moſt patient under all evil. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt ſaith,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them.</hi> See how earneſtly he urgeth the work, as if all knowledge were nothing without it; Leſt the Diſciples ſhould ſay, we knew this long agoe that we muſt be humbled; why doſt thou teach us that now, as if we had not known it before? Well, ſaith Chriſt, if ye do know theſe things, tis the better for you, but this Knowledge is not attained without obedience. I pronounce no man bleſſed for his knowledge, but for his work. If ye that have knowledge deſire to be happy, then do what ye know. Ye have ſeen the very Work in me, I alſo deſire to ſee it in you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:171778:69"/> From this of Chriſt you ſee that we have ground according to the Faith, to teach and preach good works in the Church againſt them that are enemies to works. For what elſe can we do but what Chriſt himſelf did? No Chriſtian that will keep to the words of Chriſt can condemn us. Thou therefore whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thou art, hold faſt the ſure Word of God, and ſtir not a jot from it. Read <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.
<hi>Luke</hi> 6. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thou ſhalt ſee moſt plainly that Chriſt and the Apoſtles taught good works. What have we then to do with the vain boaſting of falſe Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellers, though they have learnt much out of the Goſpel, and know all the Scriptures, when they will not do the leaſt good work?</p>
                  <p>Know therefore that the perfection of a Chriſtian doth not conſiſt in knowledge, but practice. <hi>Not the forgetfull hearer, but the doer of the work, he is bleſſed in his deed.</hi> Again,
<note place="margin">Jam. 1. &amp; 4. Matth. 7. Pſalm
103.</note> 
                     <hi>To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is ſin.</hi> So Chriſt, <hi>he that hearech my words and doth them, is like a wiſe man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>His righteouſneſs is unto childrens children; to them that keep his Covenant, and to thoſe that remember his Commandments to do them.</hi> As Chriſt had ſeparated and exempted <hi>Judas</hi> before from thoſe that were clean; <hi>Ye are clean,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>but not all;</hi> ſo here he excepteth and ſeparateth him from thoſe that are bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I ſpeak not of you all,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>q.d.</hi> I told ye that you ſhould be happy if ye would follow and imitate me. But all of ye ſhall not partake of this happineſs. There is one of you that hath no part in this word. He is ſo far from helping his fellow ſervants, that he becomes cruel to me his Lord. He will be no Miniſter, but a Thief: no imitator, but a Traytor: not an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, but a Devil; and this in a word is that moſt miſerable <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das:</hi> who neither hath Lot here among the pure, nor ſhall have there among the perfect.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By this word Chriſt pricks him again, if happily he might amend.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He ſpeaks in general, and doth name no man, to terrifie them all; for at that time they contended for ſupremacy, as we ſhall ſee anon.</p>

                     </note>Chriſt anſwereth, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <hi>He that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heel againſt me,</hi> q.d. Therefore have I with much patience forborn this veſſel of wrath fitted for deſtruction, that now that which was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined from the beginning concerning me, might be fulfilled, without any new purpoſe intervening, but in a direct courſe as it was foreknown and determined of old. This muſt not be ſo underſtood, as if <hi>Judas</hi> were compelled to betray Chriſt, leſt the Scriptures ſhould be found falſe: for then he had not been to be blamed, but commended, and his ſin muſt have lighted on God. But becauſe he would do this of his own accord, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Spirit foretold it, knowing it beforehand.</p>
                  <p>The place here quoted is taken out of <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 41.9.
<hi>He hath lift up his heel againſt me.</hi> 'Tis a proverbial ſpeech. For ſo we uſe to ſay when we would ſhew how greatly we ſcorn a man. The meaning then of the word is, He that was moſt friendly to me, who lodged long with me, who walked, ſtay'd, eat, drank, ſlept, watched with me, as a near and dear friend, whom I thought I might well truſt, yea whom I had loaden with many courteſies, he, he hath thus requited me, as now to become my worſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; And not content therewith, he uſeth all means to ſupplant and ruine me.</p>
                  <p>This complaint might well be made of <hi>Judas,</hi> for he indeed ſought to undermine Chriſt, ſo that his name might be clean put out. Yet Chriſt expreſſeth this ſin of <hi>Judas</hi> more favourably than the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> doth: for there it is not ſimply ſaid,
<hi>he hath lift up his heel againſt me,</hi> but, he hath magnified a ſupplantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt me, <hi>i. e.</hi> he hath greatly ſupplanted me. It was a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:171778:70"/> great ſupplantation indeed, when this one fellow, baſely tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling upon him, ſhould preſume to ſell him that bought and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed all men; ſurely he did lift up his heel too high, who would not buy Chriſt, but rather ſell him.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt would not only be ſlain, but firſt be ſold too, becauſe man for whoſe ſalvation he came to die, was not only dead by his tranſgreſſion, but was alſo ſold under that tranſgreſſion. For our firſt Parents could not be perſwaded to tranſgreſs the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment but with hopes of ſome advantage: <hi>Your eyes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as gods.</hi> So that the hope of being as gods was propoſed, though falſly, as the price of their tranſgreſſion. Whence the Prophet ſaith,
<note place="margin">Eſ. 52.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Ye have ſold your ſelves for nought, and ye ſhall be redeemed without money.</hi> This order is neceſſary in our ſalvation, that our Saviour ſhould be ſold and die for us, who were dead and ſold under ſin.</p>
                  <p>What <hi>Judas</hi> did ſo wickedly againſt Chriſt, hat Hereticks and Sectaries do againſt their Mother the Church. For thoſe that have been nurſed at her breaſts, and nouriſhed with her bread, do now ſpurn her with their feet: ſo that ſhe may well ſay, <hi>I have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have deſpiſed me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eſ. 1.</note> No wonder if the Church ſo ſuffer from her falſe children, when Chriſt ſuffered the ſame from a falſe Diſciple. That word of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> may not a little afright us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe it ſhews us the hainouſneſs of our ſins, which we make light account of. Who would not abominate that man who ſhould kick Chriſt at his feet? Who ſhould not dread himſelf that hath offered ſuch contempt &amp; reproach to the Son of God? But the
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, he that ſinneth againſt Chriſt, doth trample him under foot. So <hi>Paul</hi> affirmeth, that there were ſome who did tread under foot the Son of God,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.</note> over whoſe heads the great Judgement of God did hang for ſo doing.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe we are they who now eat the bread of Chriſt in the Word and Saerament, and in thoſe things which are offered to Chriſt, as goods dedicated to the Church. Let us alſo take heed, leſt we who eat Chriſts bread, trample him with our feet: eſpecially ſeeing that from the beginning they alwayes have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the worſt enemies of God, who have been taken for his beſt friends. Thus Satan the beſt of creatures, is become the greateſt adverſary of God. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were Gods choſen people,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:171778:71"/> yet they committed more Idolatry than the
<hi>Gentiles.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 5. Deut. 32.</note> So that tis ſaid of them, <hi>I fed them to the full, and they committed adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Again,
<hi>Jeſuron waxed fat, and kicked; he forſook the God that made him,</hi> &amp;c. So the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and Prieſts, whoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice typified Chriſt, were moſt forward to crucifie him. So <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> none of the leaſt of the Apoſtles, lift up his heel againſt Chriſt. And ſo now he is moſt of all trampled upon by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſuch as live wholly of his loaves. Hence the <hi>Pſalmiſt, I was a reproach among all mine enemies,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 31.</note> but eſpecially among my Neighbours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They trample on Chriſt, whoſoever they be that oppoſe and fight againſt the Goſpel under the name of Chriſt and profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel, and defame the Scriptures under a fair colour of the Scriptures, wreſting them to their own luſts: but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally they that blaſpheme Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence we learn, not to be wroth with them that wrong us, but rather do them good, as Chriſt here ſpeaking of the Traytor, is ſo far from beiny angry or ſpeaking evil of him, that he doth him good, and ſeeks to reclaim him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt foretold theſe things, leſt his Diſciples ſhould be afrighted when they ſaw them come to paſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſtrengthen their faith. <hi>But now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I have told you before,
<note place="margin">John 16.</note> that when it is come ye may believe; i. e.</hi> that by the fulfilling of this word ye may know that I am true in all my other ſayings. So afterward he foretold to the other Diſciples what ſhould befall them, which did not a little confirm them in the Faith, that Chriſt ſhould tell them before-hand what they ſhould ſuffer.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Theſe things I have told you before, that you may believe, to wit, that I can ſee into the very ſecrets of the heart. Or that ye may believe that <hi>I am,</hi> and do remain the ſame, though for a while I ſeem to die. Or that ye may believe, that I am that poor deſtitute one, whom whoſoever conſidereth ſhall be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as it is in the ſame
<hi>Pſalm.</hi> Or that ye may believe, that I am that very man that ſpake in the ſame place,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 41.1,2.</note> 
                     <hi>Shall not he that ſleepeth awake and riſe again?</hi> (So the vulg. Lat.) <hi>But thou, O Lord,
<note place="margin">verſe 8. verſe 10.</note> be merciful unto me, raiſe me up, that I may requite them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, He addeth, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, he that receiveth
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:171778:71"/> whomſover I ſend, receiveth me,</hi> &amp;c. By which Word,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He calls back the Traytor to his duty and office, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lureth him to continue in it perſeveringly.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He terrifieth him; for if he did not perſevere, he ſhews him that he would not ſin only againſt him, but againſt God alſo. Or thus,</p>
                  <p>He had before comforted his Diſciples, and told them that they ſhould patiently endure adverſity and bear the croſs, if they would but conſider what he himſelf had ſuffered, and that the ſervant neither is, nor ought to be above his Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now he doth comfort them another way, telling them that they ſhould find friends as well as foes in the world, who ſhould uſe them civilly and receive them kindly.
<hi>q.d.</hi> This ſhall be your happineſs in the world. Behold, I ſend a Cryers voyce before you, which ſhall ſound through all the world, that they which receive me, may then be truly confident that they have received me indeed, if they ſhall receive you as my very ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And that ye may not think it a ſmall reward to receive me becauſe I am now deſpiſed in the world, lo I ſay unto you, <hi>He that receiveth me, receiveth my Father alſo.</hi> When the children that are ſcattered abroad in the world ſhall hear this, they will entertain and honour you very highly. Thus before he ſent out the Apoſtles, he provided meat and lodging for them, and with large Promiſes encouraged men to receive them: as in the firſt creation, before he made man he prepared all neceſſaries for him, as a place to dwell in, food to live on, and light to walk by.</p>
                  <p>It is a good and comfortable gradation from the Diſciples to Chriſt, and from Chriſt to the Father, beyond or above whom there is no going, or aſcending farther. Chriſt here ſpeaks ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his humanity, leſt any <hi>Arrian</hi> ſhould hence infer that Chriſt was inferiour to the Father according to his Divinity.</p>
                  <p>The ſame gradation you have in receiving the Apoſtles,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 10. &amp; <hi>Luke</hi> 9. And this is much more excellent than what is ſaid of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot,</hi> who received but Angels inſtead of men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. &amp; 19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.</p>
                  <p>This Reception of the Apoſtles doth not conſiſt only in civi uſage and entertainment, but chiefly in receiving and embracing their preaching of the Goſpel. In which ſenſe we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that,
<hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:171778:72"/> John</hi> 1. Chriſt therefore comforteth his Apoſtles with theſe words, to aſſure them that their authority ſhould be had in great reverence among men, notwithſtanding <hi>Judas</hi> was ſo wicked.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt alſo here intimateth by what ſteps we aſcend to God. We cannot come to the Father but by Chriſt;
<note place="margin">John 14.</note> for he is the Way. We cannot come to Chriſt, but we muſt firſt receive the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, their word I mean. We muſt begin at hearing the word. He that receiveth this, receiveth Chriſt. He that hath Chriſt, hath the Father. He that hath the Father, hath all good. This place may alſo be underſtood of the poor, whom we may then ſuppoſe to be ſent to us of God when they meet us, beg of us, and make known their neceſſities to us. He that receiveth ſuch, receiveth Chriſt and God, and in the day of Judgement they ſhall hear this,
<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note>
                     <hi>What ye have done unto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye have done it to me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ye ſee then what great things are promiſed to thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Apoſtles and the poor. As it is ſaid in <hi>Matthew, He that ſhall give unto one of the leaſt of theſe a cup of cold water to drink, he ſhall not loſe his reward.</hi> Whereby Chriſt doth ſtir us up diligently to hear the Apoſtles Doctrine, and readily ſupply the poors neceſſity.</p>

<hi>which betrayed him, anſwered, and ſaid, Maſter, is it I? He ſaid unto him, Thou haſt ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Paſſion of Chriſt drew nigh, the worſt and moſt miſerable caſe of that wicked <hi>Judas</hi> is firſt ſet down. And let none wonder that there is ſo much ſaid; villanous varlet, his
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:171778:72"/> vile fact required many words to ſet it forth for a warning and caution to all others.</p>
                  <p>Being then about to ſpeak of the Traytors ſin, he is firſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in ſpirit, <hi>i. e.</hi> inwardly, as elſwhere it is ſaid, <hi>Now is my ſoul troubled!</hi> For the word (Spirit) is here taken like that,
<note place="margin">John 11.33.</note> where it is ſaid,
<hi>He groaned in the Spirit, and was troubled:</hi> which alſo is not to be underſtood of the Holy Spirit, but of the inward man. For certainly Chriſt took into, or upon him, thoſe natural affections, and ſhewed that he had them, yet without ſin. Whence tis plain, againſt the <hi>Valentinians,</hi> that Chriſt had a true humane nature, as elſwhere, when we read, <hi>that he wept, and was weary,</hi> Luke 19. John 4.</p>
                  <p>Therefore as Chriſt was troubled when he raiſed
<hi>Lazarus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 11.</note> and groaned againſt the power and tyrannie of ſin and death, wherewith all men were oppreſſed: ſo here he is troubled at the execration and hardening of <hi>Judas,</hi> who ſtill went in his wicked reſolution after ſo many warnings, and ſuch great kindneſs ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. This trouble then of Chriſt was,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. His hatred of <hi>Judas</hi> his ſin, as will eaſily appear, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the deſire and care of Chriſt to ſave him, yea and all the people of the <hi>Jews,</hi> of whom <hi>Judas</hi> was a type and figure. Well therefore might Chriſt take it ill at <hi>Judas</hi> his hands, who was one much honoured among the other Apoſtles, yet by a little pelſe was enticed to reject Chriſts love, nothing at all mindfull of his glory, or the bonds of his fellowſhip, or the devotion and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence due to him as God, or of any his Miracles, but only look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the odious and paltry pelf of the <hi>Jews,</hi> for which he ſold even his own ſoul, and betrayed the moſt innocent and righteous blood into the hands of ſinfull men.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Chriſt was troubled at the greatneſs of the ſcandal, that one of his chief Apoſtles ſhould revolt and prove treacherous to him: By reaſon whereof he foreknew that many weak ones would after this be eſtranged from him, and have an ill opinion of him, inaſmuch as his familiar acquaintance and intimate friends revolt from him. How near theſe things ſtruck to the heart of Chriſt, no tongue can expreſs.</p>
                  <p>We learn hence, what a Chriſtian ſhould be troubled at: Not from any outward miſery, but out of a mercifulneſs toward his Neighbour, whom he ſeeth obſtinate in ſin. By this trouble
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:171778:73"/> of Chriſt it is evident enough, that God hateth ſin, but moſt of all ingratitude and impenitency, both which were notoriouſly in <hi>Judas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, This trouble of Chriſt ſhews that he had a moſt godly ſoul, becauſe men are puniſhed and do periſh ſore againſt his will,
<note place="margin">Iſ. 1.</note> as he ſaith in <hi>Iſa. Heu, conſolabor ſuper hoſtibus meis, Ah, I will eaſe me of mine enemies.</hi> Which is no ſmall comfort to us to hear that God is not willing to puniſh us, nor will he if we ſin not obſtinately. He had rather ſhew us mercy, and do us good.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This trouble of Chriſt ſhews us, how we ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all thoſe envious paſſions of our enemies, when they ſtrive to do the worſt they can againſt us without a cauſe, to wit, not by curſing and banning, but by bleſſing and benefiting them, as Chriſt here did, and as <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>Overcome evil with good, Rom.</hi>
12. What did Chriſt do? Did he curſe and revile <hi>Judas?</hi> We need not curſe wicked men:
<note place="margin">Prov. 24.</note> they are curſed long ſince, and their deſtruction maketh haſte. But what doth he? Doth he accuſe and traduce him? No ſuch matter. What then? He doth piouſly warn him, ſhewing him that his naughty will was well enough known. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, that one of you ſhall betray me.</hi> O the wonderfull goodneſs of Chriſt! For we may here ſee how fitly he compared himſelf to a Hen;
<note place="margin">Matth. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>would I have gathered thy children as a Hen, and thou wouldeſt not?</hi> This he doth here really ſhew, for he had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the other Diſciples under his wings. Now,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He labours to recall the wanderer and him that was ready to be deſtroyed. And although he had hitherto admoniſhed him in vain, yet he doth not give him over: to teach us that we ſhould not too ſuddenly deſpair of our amendment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A wicked man is not preſently to be caſt off before all wayes and means are uſed for his recovery.
<note place="margin">Gal. 6.</note> So ſaith <hi>Paul, If any be overtaken with a fault,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 18.</note> &amp;c. inſtruct or reſtore him in the ſpirit of meekneſs. So Chriſt, <hi>If thy brother offend thee, go and reprove him between him and thee alone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As Chriſt here doth not forbear to prick <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſet his ſin before him, although he knew that he would not amend: ſo is it ſtill by the righteous Judgement of God; many that will not amend muſt feel the worm of conſcience whether they will or
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:171778:73"/> no, to make that of the Prophet true,
<note place="margin">Iſ. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no peace to the wicked.</hi> Here he doth double his word, <hi>Verily, verily,</hi> as well to ſtir up their attention, as to ſhew the certainty of his word.</p>
                  <p>It is to be Noted, that although Chriſt doth diſcloſe the ſin of <hi>Judas,</hi> yet he doth conceal his perſon, leſt he ſhould either break out into a rage againſt Chriſt being confounded by his, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudently preſume to deny it. Teaching us thereby what we ſhould do to our brethren in the caſe of cloſe ſins, even do as we would be done unto.</p>
                  <p>But he ſpeaks to all, that all might fear,
<note place="margin">Rom. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>And bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes. Be not high minded, but fear.</hi> Now in that he doth ſo clearly convince them that he knew all their ſins, never ſo ſecret, he doth thereby deter both them and us, not only from ſinfull acts, but alſo from evil thoughts and purpoſes. Hence <hi>Boethius</hi> ſaith well, There is great neceſſity for us to live godlily, becauſe he that beholdeth all things doth ſee all that we do.</p>
                  <p>What effect this word took in the hearts of the Diſciples, doth appear by what is there ſaid: <hi>They were ſad, they looked one on another.</hi> And no marvell; every one knew-himſelf guiltleſs, and none thought any evil of the other. Yet,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They did not doubt but that Chriſt ſpake the truth. They only wondered how the Devil could ſo far prevail as to be able to get away one of them, and ſnatch him from the fellowſhip of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Every one feared his own heart, and though they knew no ſuch thing by themſelves, yet they all ſuſpected the frailty of their fleſh They might ſay with <hi>Paul, I know nothing by my ſelf,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.</note> yet am I not thereby juſtified.</hi> It is a ſign of a good and godly heart to tremble at the Judgements and Word of God. On the contrary, tis the ſign of an obſtinate mind, to be nothing moved thereat, as here <hi>Judas,</hi> he only is fearleſs, and perſiſts in the ſame impudence; he dares ſit with his brazen face at the holy Banquet. But could he there endure the piercing eyes of his Lord, which he knew ſaw all things and the ſecret machinations of his heart at that time?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They were not a little troubled to think that ſo holy a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſortſhip ſhould be ſo much defamed by ſo vile and hainous a crime.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="tcp:171778:74"/> Here then tis plain that <hi>Judas</hi> durſt not diſcloſe what he plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt Chriſt to any of his fellow-Diſciples, which made for their commendation, but turned to his condemnation, who could be ſo wicked among ſo many godly men. Now the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples nothing doubting but that all that Chriſt ſaid was true, and yet could not ſuſpect which of them ſhould be ſo baſe to do ſo, they look one on another to ſee if any would diſcover the ſame by his bluſhing. And every one of them ſaith to Chriſt, <hi>Lord, is it I?</hi> Their Faith thought better of Chriſts words than of their own conſciences. Therefore they do not ſay, Lord, I am not the man, excuſing themſelves, ſaying, tis not I, but Lord, is it I, or no? by way of Quere, <hi>q.d.</hi> God forbid that ever we ſhould commit ſuch a horrid fact againſt our good Lord and Maſter, with whom we have gone thorow fire and water, ſuffered good and evil, whom we have followed rather than any man, and for whom we have forſaken all things.</p>
                  <p>Surely there was little worldly mirth and jollity at this Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, where both Lord and ſervants were ſo ſadly ſorrowfull. Here could be no laughter or lightneſs, when thoſe godly men heard what a horrible thing ſhould break out from among them: but could not tell who ſhould act or contrive it, in which uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty they were held in ſuſpence for a time, the Lord ſo ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing what he before had ſpoken for their comfort.</p>
                  <p>And that which made them yet more ſorrowfull, was, that Chriſt would not anſwer when they askt the queſtion, but leaves them ſtill in ſuſpence, repeating the ſame word again with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vehemency; <hi>One of the twelve,</hi> I ſay, <hi>which dippeth his hand with me in the diſh, he ſhall betray me,</hi> q.d. It is one of the twelve who is ſo familiar with me, that he puts his hand into the ſame diſh with me: and for this freedom and reſpect which I ſhew him he doth thus requite me. Mark it, he doth give no other deſcription of the Traytor,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 41.</note> but what <hi>David</hi> gave long ſince, when he ſpake in the perſon of Chriſt, <hi>Vir pacis,</hi> mine own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar friend in whom I truſted, <hi>which did eat of my bread, he hath lift up his heel againſt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the words following are very heavenly; <hi>The Son of man indeed goeth as it is written of him,</hi> q.d. there is nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me happened contrary to my expectation, but as it was long ſince foretold by the Prophets, ſo it cometh to paſs; I muſt
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:171778:74"/> die indeed that I may mercifully redeem mankind according to the counſell and fore-purpoſe of Gods Divine Majeſtie; And it is expedient for many, that I, ſhould be betrayed, but wo be to the man for all that, by whom I am betrayed. He will thereby procure ſalvation for others, but he will bring perpetual deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon himſelf. The day of other mens Nativity is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſolemnized with great joy, but this mans birth-day de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be noted with a black coal: Nay it had been better for him if he had never been born. For it is better not to be at all, than to be in perpetual torments; which is all one as to have a death without death.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt would hereby afright <hi>Judas</hi> to terrifie him from his evil purpoſe with threats of eternal damnation, whom he could not recall by ſo many courteſies. But all the while for bearing to name him, to teach us that we ſhould admoniſh ſinners, but not traduce them. And if there be any good in them, tis better hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>Periphraſis</hi> or circumlocution, than to particulariſe them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Judas</hi> was paſt repentance, yet Chriſts goodneſs is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly commended who omitted nothing that might tend to his converſion and reformation.</p>
                  <p>Now Chriſt by this word; <hi>The Son of man goeth indeed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but wo to that man,</hi> &amp;c. and teacheth us not to hurt or perſecute Chriſt in his members. It is decreed that the righteous ſhall be afflicted: all that will live godly ſhall ſuffer perſecution. But wo to them that do afflict them:
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3. Matth. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>Take heed that ye offend not one of the leaſt of theſe.</hi> Yet ſee the obſtinate malice of <hi>Judas.</hi> As he was nothing moved by that eminent Pattern of Charity which Chriſt gave him at and after Supper: ſo is he as little moved by this hard and horrible commination. And leſt his ſilence ſhould bewray him after all the reſt had askt concerning themſelves, he throws out a malepert and ſnappiſh anſwer, <hi>Is it I, Maſter?</hi> q.d. Thou canſt ſuſpect no ſuch thing of me. God forbid that I, whom thou haſt ſo far intruſted, ſhould prove ſo baſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. See here,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The impiety of mans heart, how it ſtrives (if poſſible) to deceive God, yea to make God a lyar.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Notorious hypocriſie; he durſt call him Maſter whom he had reſolved immediately to deliver to death.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="98" facs="tcp:171778:75"/> 3. Obſtinacy and impudence added to his malice, which are moſt infallible ſignes of a moſt fearful judgement. Chriſt warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>Judas,</hi> but doth no good on him: he foretels his judgement, but he turneth the deaf ear. Who would not here be afraid? yea who would not pray with all his heart, that he may never fall under ſuch a judgement, and into ſuch hardneſs of heart?</p>
                  <p>Nor doth Chriſt yet diſcover him openly, but only ſaith,
<hi>Thou haſt ſaid,</hi> q, d. thou haſt plainly bewrayed thy ſelf. Ask thy own conſcience: That will accuſe thee, if I ſay nothing. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thou art that famous Apoſtle and faithful Miniſter, upon whom I have ſo well beſtowed all my kindneſſes, and who doſt ſo excellently anſwer thy name and office! Hold thy peace vile Traytor, bear thy badge and pack hence to thy old confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates. Theſe things Chriſt ſpake to the Traytors conſcience: but did not point him out with the finger; a Pattern to us, not to diſcloſe the cloſe ſins of others. As tis a ſin to charge a falſe crime on an innocent perſon; ſo is it a ſin to blazon a ſecret ſlip indeed, becauſe it is a breach of charity to our Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now there was leaning on Jeſus boſom one of his Diſciples whom Jeſus loved.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 13.23. verſe 24. verſe 25.</note> Simon Peter <hi>therefore beckoned to him, that he ſhould ask who it was of whom he ſpake. He then lying on Jeſus breaſt, ſaith unto him,
<note place="margin">verſe 26.</note> Lord, who is it? Jeſus anſwered, he it is to whom I ſhall give a ſop, when I have dipped it. And when he had dipped the ſop,
<note place="margin">verſe 27.</note> he gave it to</hi> Judas Iſcariot <hi>the ſon of</hi> Simon. <hi>And after the ſop, Satan entered into him. Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, That thou doeſt,
<note place="margin">verſe 28. verſe 29.</note> do quickly. Now no man at the Table knew for what intent he ſpake this unto him. For ſome of them thought, becauſe</hi> Judas <hi>had the bag, that Jeſus had ſaid unto him. Buy thoſe things that we have need of againſt the feaſt: or that he ſhould give ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the poor.
<note place="margin">verſe 30.</note> He then having received the ſop, went immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out, and it was night.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The nameleſs Diſciple ſo honourably here mentioned, was
<hi>John,</hi> who was more eminent then the reſt for theſe two things,
<hi>viz.</hi> that Chriſt loved him, and that he leaned on his breaſt, and lay in his boſom. And though he writeth this of himſelf, yet he doth it without boaſting. but as it were compell'd to it, that his Goſpel might be confirmed by his own authority. For if all the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> be ſuch competent witneſſes, that it is groſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief to queſtion their teſtimony in the leaſt, This of all other
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:171778:75"/> witneſſes deſerves to be credited, who was ſo converſant with, and ſo near unto the Truth which he relateth, that he lay in the very boſom of it; he above all mortal men was admitted ſo nigh unto that word which boiled out of the heart of the Father, and was made fleſh, that he reſolved to make his tongue and pen trumpet it out louder than the reſt. As <hi>Paul</hi> being in a ſort com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by the baſeneſs of the falſe Apoſtles to commend himſelf among the
<hi>Corinthians, I am a fool,</hi> ſaith he,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>but ye have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled me:</hi> So doth <hi>John</hi> here by reaſon of ſome perverſe Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks: yet out of humility concealeth his own name. Now whereas he leaned on his Lords breaſt, that was either,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By reaſon of over much ſorrow and fear becauſe of the word which Chriſt had ſpoken. Or,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe of the ſweetneſs which he taſted in the former words and works of Chriſt. Or,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From the abundance or muchneſs of his love, which doth not ſo much mind what it is about, ſo it may embrace its belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Or,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Out of extraordinary contemplation. For tis poſſible that the extream intenſneſs of his mind might caſt him into a trance.
<note place="margin">John 1.</note> And queſtionleſs in that Rapture he might learn thoſe ſublime high things which afterward he wrote concerning the Divinity of the Word.</p>
                  <p>O how happy was this Diſciple, who lay ſo familiarly on his breaſt, whom others thought it a great happineſs but to ſee at a diſtance, and to lie but at his feet, <hi>Shew us thy face,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 80.</note> and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>See the mildneſs of Chriſt: He doth not thruſt back this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that leaned on him, though it were at a feaſt, where 'twas little good manners ſo to do, but accepted of this his reſpect and love, and took it in good part. Now that ſweet and quiet repoſe on his Lords breaſt was a preſage that he only of all the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſhould die in peace, and not ſuffer a violent death as the reſt did; as the event made it good. And here we ſee alſo how truly Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are the pure in heart, for they ſhall ſee God.</hi>

                  <p>From this leaning of <hi>John</hi> upon his Lords breaſt,
<hi>Peter</hi> took occaſion to ſift out who the Traytor was. As we find him every
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:171778:76"/> where more eager and hot, ſo now he is ſtreightened, ſolicitous, and more inquiſitive than the reſt of the Apoſtles. He would fain know the Traytor, that he might prevent and hinder him, leſt the whole Colledge ſhould be diſgraced by ſo great a villany. For this wicked lewdneſs of <hi>Judas</hi> was often caſt in the teeth of the Apoſtles and other Martyrs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> himſelf doth not ask the queſtion: for he never yet ſped ſo well for his boldneſs, though his love to his Maſter put him forward.
<note place="margin">Matth. 16. John 13.</note> It was ſaid to him before, <hi>Get thee behind me, Satan.</hi> And but now at Supper: <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me;</hi> therefore he gets a ſpokeſman. Nor doth Chriſt refuſe to anſwer when <hi>John</hi> whiſpered him in the ear, leſt it ſhould ſeem that what he had ſpoken of <hi>Judas</hi> before, was out of a doubtfull ſuſpition rather than from any certain knowledge beforehand. Therefore he doth by a plain ſign point out the perſon of the Traytor <hi>Judas,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He it is to whom I ſhall give a ſop when I have dipped it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. He doth not point him out with the finger, or by name, leſt it ſhould cauſe a diſturbance at the feaſt, and the other Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhould fall upon him. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He doth diſcover him by a piece of bread: either that the Propheſie might appear moſt true, <hi>He that eateth bread with me,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſalm 41. Rom. 12.</note> &amp;c. Or that he firſt might do that which afterward he taught <hi>Paul</hi> to do, <hi>If thy enemy hunger, feed him: for in ſo doing thou ſhalt heap coals of fire on his head.</hi> Thus Chriſt patiently fed his enemy like a harmleſs child: but like the Antient of dayes he poured coals of fire upon his head. Although <hi>Judas</hi> was not toucht with the coals of Repentance (with which we ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire all our enemies to be burnt, yea though they are the worſe for our kindneſs and courteſie) yet he was burnt with ſcorching wrath, as will appear anon.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas the Diſciples eat of the ſame diſh with Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Myſtical ſenſe.</note> the myſtical meaning is, that Believers do partake in the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">1.</note>But <hi>Judas</hi> who alſo took out of the ſame diſh, but with a wicked mind, ſignifieth Hereticks and Hypocrites, for even they ſometimes ſuffer, but not for Chriſt.
<note place="margin">2.</note>He likewiſe ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth all wicked men, to whom Chriſt carveth out of his own diſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> he layeth his Croſs upon them, but to their perdition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judas</hi> takes this bread too with the ſame impudence, as before
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:171778:76"/> he had the Sacrament of Chriſts body, and afterward kiſſed him. But he took this bread to his great prejudice: for preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after the ſop Satan entered into him. A horrible word indeed, but the thing it ſelf was much more horrid, that a man ſhould come to ſuch miſery and misfortune, that the Devil ſhould poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs him as his own. And yet it is no wonder that the Devil ſhould there get entrance, where Chriſt is altogether ſhut out. <hi>Judas</hi> indeed had Satan before. For by his inſtinct he pickt his Maſters purſe, murmured at the woman that anointed him, and conſented with Chriſts enemies to betray him. But as yet Satan was not diſcovered in him. None but Chriſt ſaw him. Now he is revealed and ſhews himſelf openly, when <hi>Judas</hi> went forth and led the Van of that wicked Army. There are ſins in us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes: anger, envy, luxury, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they lie lurking in us till there be occaſion given for them to break out.</p>
                  <p>Satan then entered into <hi>Judas,</hi> becauſe he whom hitherto he had only outwardly enticed to ſin, now he doth fully and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly take poſſeſſion of him. Whom he firſt made wicked, now he makes incurable: ſo that he who firſt ſold Chriſt for the only hope of gain, his rancour now encreaſing, his hatred mixt with covetouſneſs, he belcheth out all his cruelty and breathes forth greater hatred againſt him who pluckt off his vizard and made him known.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of all is, that <hi>Judas</hi> had now altogether hardened himſelf to ſin, and ſet his mind wholly to it, and became ſo like the Devil that he refuſed to return, yea he was the worſe for all Chriſts kindneſſes. And this is that curſe which the Holy Spirit long ſince by the mouth of <hi>David</hi> prayed might fall upon him, <hi>Set thou a ſinner over him,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 109.</note> and let the Devil ſtand at his right hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which muſt not be ſo underſtood, as though that ſop was any evil thing, or the cauſe of his hardning. The ſop did not force him within the reach, nor thruſt him under the power of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but his own ingratitude and impenitence, becauſe he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in his wicked counſell, and was not toucht with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, nor moved with any admonition of Chriſt, but altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhameleſs, when he ſaw that Chriſt knew all things; yea he was more and more on fire with a burning deſire to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate his horrid act, and ſo caſt away and ſcorned the benedicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:171778:77"/> of Chriſt. No marvell then if he run into curſing which he ſo much loved: ſo that the Devil entered into his ſoul, which he found then utterly forſaken of God. Although the Devil doth never give over to tempt men, yet he doth eſpecially drive us whether he ſees us moſt inclined to go of our own accord.</p>
                  <p>Let us then give diligent heed and watch continually that we give him not his firſt, nor open the gates of our heart to him: for if he once get in adores, he will quickly run over all the houſe till he hath totally deſtroyed a man. Let that miſerable <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> be our Example, whom the Devil ſo invaded and poſſeſt his ſoul and ſences, that he could do nothing but what the Devil enjoyned him, after he was deſerted of Chriſt and cut off from the fellowſhip of the Saints.
<note place="margin">Eccl. 10.4.</note> Hence the Wiſe man warneth, <hi>If the ſpirit of the Ruler riſe up againſt thee, leave not thy place,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we cannot deny him, that he tempt not at all, but let us not give place to him.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe <hi>Judas</hi> was in a manner made manifeſt, and could not with ſafety ſtay there any longer, and becauſe he was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently warned, but was never the better, Chriſt puts him in mind,
<hi>What thou doeſt, do quickly;</hi> which ſounds as if Chriſt would kindle and ſpur him forward who was incenſ'd before, and whoſe rage was rather to be reſtrained, yet indeed he was rather threatened thereby than exhorted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>Nor doth Chriſt ſpeak this to
<hi>Judas</hi> only, but eſpecially to the Devil, who had already entered into him, <hi>q.d.</hi> Do thy work, O thou Devil, which thou haſt alwayes delighted to do; do it quickly. Thou gotteſt into the ſouls of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> and killedſt the Prophets: Thou ſtonedſt them that brought the Doctrine of Salvation; thou ſparedſt none that were ſent from God. I am come after them, and I well know that thou canſt not be quiet and let me alone: wherefore now take thy courſe, do as thou wert wont, and as thou wouldeſt have gladly done long ſince, if I had not reſtrained thee. Take thy ſwing, I'le hinder thee no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Tis all one as if a ſtrong man ſhould threaten his enemy and ſpeak ſcoffingly to him, knowing him to be but a punie fellow and to be conquered with a filip, ſhould yet ſay, Do what thou doeſt quickly, that thou mayeſt preſently try how ſtrong I am, and know it by experience. So Chriſt bids the Devil run faſter and make more haſte to do what he was ready to do, that being
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:171778:77"/> overcome and bound by his tryanny, he might ſooner releaſe the world.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>If we refer this word to
<hi>Judas,</hi> then it is not a Precept, but a permiſſion, as in
<hi>Job</hi> it is ſaid to the Devil,
<note place="margin">Job 1.</note>
                     <hi>Behold, he is in thy hand.</hi> So here, <hi>Judas</hi> is not commanded to do the evil he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but is permitted to do it ſooner. Tis one thing to ſay to a man that is about a thing, make haſte and do it quickly: and another thing to ſay to one that is at leiſure, or command an idle perſon to do this or that.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>But this word is nothing but for the judgement and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Judas</hi> who was now obſtinately malicious. It is ſuch an expreſſion as Parents uſe to their ſtubborn and incorrigible children: as if Chriſt had ſaid, Well, now I ſee all my kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes will not invite thee to amendment, go on, make an end of what thou haſt begun: I will not let or ſtop thee any more; Thou wouldſt not hearken to me, therefore get thee after the Devil and follow him another while: But I tell thee this before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, never look to go to Heaven. From this time forward I leave thee to thy own will, ſink or ſwim, ſhift as thou canſt, I'le take no more care of thee. A horrible Judgement indeed, ſo to be forſaken of God. Wherefore <hi>David</hi> had cauſe to ſay,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 51.</note> 
                     <hi>Caſt me not away from thy preſence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">4.</note>By this word Chriſt ſheweth his hearts great deſire to redeem man. Therefore he bids the Traytor not be too ſlow, but <hi>make haſte,</hi> q.d. Haſt a mind to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                     <note place="margin">5.</note>Laſtly, In this word he fully reſigneth both his own life, and his deſire of ſaving <hi>Judas</hi> to the will of his Father, nor his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of <hi>Judas</hi> his ſalvation only, but of that people whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented too, and the falſe Church alſo which he prefigured.

Now he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigneth them to the Fathers will, teaching us to do ſo to, when it cannot be otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:171778:78"/> And leſt any ſhould think it ſtrange how the other Diſciples could bear this impiety of <hi>Judas</hi> againſt Chriſt, <hi>No man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>at the table knew,</hi> &amp;c. This was an infallible ſign of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles goodneſs, in that they had no evil ſurmiſings of <hi>Judas: Charity thinketh no evil.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas they thought that he was commanded either to get things ready againſt the feaſt, or to give ſomething to the poor, he intimateth that Chriſt did carefully give this in charge to him, eſpecially at the Feaſt. Thereby teaching us to provide for the poor at our Feaſts, a thing moſt acceptable to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But here the Diſciples were much miſtaken in their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For that wicked man did not ſo much ſeek to grace the Feaſt as to diſgrace it: he was not ſo much for the poor, as againſt the Father of the poor. Wherefore he was not fit to be any longer in ſo holy a fellowſhip. And now the Devil who had been his maſter all this while, inſtigateth him afreſh, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently he went forth after he had taken the ſop. But,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He went out judged and condemned, leaving his Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick to another.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He went out; he was not thruſt out, he did voluntarily of his own accord ſeparate himſelf from Chriſt and the Saints: than which there is no ſeparation more miſerable. Again,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He went forth <hi>preſently.</hi> So that tis plain he had a liſt to be gone ſooner, but he had not leave, or a fit opportunity; but as ſoon as it was granted him, he forthwith departed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He preſently went forth; for now the Devil had got ſtronger hold of him, and ruled him by force, haling him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Devil haſtened him for fear of delay and the power of Chriſts words, leſt any ſpark of Grace ſhould be kindled again in the ſoul of <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſo he eſcape out of his ſnares. For the Devil is exceeding wary, leſt any ſlip from him when he hath once caught them.

                  <p>Although this Hiſtory makes nothing to the ſuffering of Chriſt, yet becauſe <hi>Luke</hi> hath inſerted it in the Paſſion of our Lord, we will not paſs it by. For it doth fairly picture out the humane nature and diſpoſition that was in the Apoſtles, who
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:171778:79"/> contended for primacy at that time, when they ſaw ſuch great Patterns of Humility and Modeſty; and when the greateſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulation was at hand. But what our Tranſlation renders
<hi>ſtrife</hi> or <hi>contention,</hi> that <hi>Luke</hi> calleth
<hi>Philoniciam, i. e.</hi> Love of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</p>
                  <p>We read more then once how the Apoſtles contended about Primacy.
<note place="margin">Matth. 18. &amp; 20.</note> After the payment of tribute they askt Chriſts opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and deſired him to decide the matter which of them ſhould be the greateſt. So when the ſons of
<hi>Zebedee</hi> ſought the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſeat in Chriſts Kingdom, then they ſtrove about this thing. And here in this place.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Perhaps <hi>Judas</hi> his going from them gave the occaſion. For till his hatred was diſcovered they ſuſpected one another, and ſo from hence quickly fell to quarrelling, every one diſdaining to be inferiour to other, and to be, or but thought to be leſs faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their Lords own withdrawing, which he ſpake of before to them, might happily give them occaſion to enquire what they ſhould do, and who ſhould have the chief management of things when their Maſter was gone from them. Here now, as common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is, none could well bear to ſubmit to another; and ſo (as he thought) be undervalued: which is no ſtrange thing that it ſhould be ſo with the Apoſtles who were men, and not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the Holy Spirit, nor fully underſtanding the Kingdom of Chriſt. Now Chriſt neither will nor can he endure by any means this Philotimie or greedy deſire of Glory, which is the root of Philonicie or love of Victory, whence all contention ariſeth. For where one will rule, and none ſubmit; where all will be Lords, and none ſubjects, there Chriſt hath no more to do. What then?</p>
                  <p>My Diſciples and Children, ſaith he, do not do thus, it is very unſeemly, and doth not at all become you. I would not have it ſo among you. Conſider I pray, what think ye? Do you not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to Lord it like the world? but do you ſee any ſuch thing in me? where got ye this thought? whence came this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? ye that are ſervants, would ye once more be greater than me your Lord? Indeed the <hi>Romans</hi> and other
<hi>Gentiles</hi> go about to compaſs to themſelves worldly glory and greatneſs, and above all things deſire to domineer and rule over others. They
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:171778:79"/> hunt after great Titles, not only to be called Kings, Princes,

And ye fiſher-men of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liles,</hi> will you be like theſe, and do as the Heathen do?

                  <p>When <hi>Iudas</hi> was gone Chriſt begins to preach a moſt joyfull Sermon, full of admirable conſolation: wherein firſt he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warneth his Diſciples not to be offended at the Croſs which now hung over his head; and with them admoniſheth all the godly not to deny him becauſe of the Croſs.

                     <note place="margin">3.</note>Now is he glorified, <hi>i. e.</hi> by this ſeparation of <hi>Judas</hi> from the Elect Apoſtles, was fore-ſhewn the glorification of Chriſt, which he ſhall have at the day of Judgement, when he ſhall ſeparate the godly from the wicked, whereby his truth and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs will appear.</p>

                     <pb n="110" facs="tcp:171778:82"/>
                     <note place="margin">4.</note>But laſtly, by
<hi>glorifying</hi> is underſtood the brightneſs of Chriſts Paſſion gliſtering and flaſhing in among the damned, the Glory of his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, and the gift of pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Holy Ghoſt. <hi>Now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is the ſon of man glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 12.</note> to wit, with that Glory which he ſpake of: <hi>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all unto me; if a grain of wheat die in the earth, it bringeth forth much fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But mark with what Majeſtie Chriſt ſpeaks of his death. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man would have ſpoken of it after the worlds ſence: Now is the Son of man betrayed, made an abject, condemn'd, and there's an end of him,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> But Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Now is the ſon of man glorified:</hi> whereby he ſheweth,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That he was exceeding glad to Redeem mankind by his death upon the Croſs; it was as much joy to him, as for others to go to a Banquet or Feaſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That his Croſs was nothing but an entrance to his Crown; ſo that <hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Iews</hi> did nothing but promote his glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>q.d.</hi> Let <hi>Judas</hi> go whither he will, let him betray me, let him ſtir up all the world againſt me, let him do his worſt: It ſhall be to my Glory, and his utter diſgrace. If he had gone ſooner, I ſhould have been ſooner glorified: I am troubled at nothing but his malice, which only will wound me.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although treachery, reproach, the croſs and death be ſuch bug-bears to the world, yet to a godly man they are moſt deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, becauſe there is no other way to Glory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, He ſheweth that by his death and Paſſion he was about to turn all the curſes of the Law into bleſſings. The Law ſaith,
<note place="margin">Deut. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Curſed is he that hangeth on a tree.</hi> So likewiſe all outward evils, as hunger, thirſt, perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which the Law ſaith are curſes: But Chriſt tels us that they are the Inſtruments and means of our glorification and bleſſing: for ſo it is that by his death theſe things can no more hurt us at all. By him all things are ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>Now although Chriſt was glorified before by his Miracles, (for he that allayed the waves of the ſea and the force of wind,
<note place="margin">Matth. 14.</note> was worſhipped as the Son of God; So when he fed five thouſand men with five loaves of bread, the people ſaw ſuch glory in him, that they would preſently have made him King.
<note place="margin">John 6.</note> When he raiſed
<hi>Lazarus</hi> to life, his Glory was ſo great, that they publiquely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:171778:82"/> him in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with ſongs and ſhouts.
<note place="margin">Matth. 21.</note> He was truly glorified by the greatneſs of Myracles:) yet becauſe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of his Glory was in the Paſſion, Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion, therefore he ſaith, <hi>Now is he glorified,</hi> &amp;c. Teaching us, that we ſhould chuſe rather to be deſpiſed of men, than be praiſed by them, becauſe by the one we become proud, in the other there is no ſuch danger.</p>
                  <p>He ſpeaks it Emphatically, <hi>Now is the Son glorified,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Clarificatus eſt.</note> by a verb of the preterperfect tenſe: for though it was not yet perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was in agitation, and to be perfected without all doubt. So he ſpeaks afterward;
<hi>I am non ſum in mundo,
<note place="margin">John 17.</note> how I am no more in the world:</hi> There is an Emphaſis too, when he ſaith the ſon of
<hi>man</hi> is glorified. For the Son of God ever was, and ſtill is glorious. What therefore the Son of God had by Nature, that the ſon of man had by Grace and Union with the Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>But queſtionleſs this glorifying of the ſon of man is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying of God. Therefore he added, <hi>And God is glorified by him;</hi> as the Father and the Son have one nature, ſo have they one glory. Whence it is that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he ſought not his own glory, but the glory of the Father.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>And yet the Father is not ſo glorified, as if he had now eſſentially ſome glory which he had not before: but becauſe it was now cleared up by the Paſſion and Reſurrection of Chriſt, of which Son God was the Father.
<note place="margin">2.</note>As alſo becauſe by the Paſſion and Reſurrection God got him Glory among men, whom the world knew not before, but now by Chriſt they knew that he was their Father and Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And leſt any ſhould queſtion how Chriſt came to know ſo clearly and certainly beforehand, that God would glorifie him: He anſwereth, <hi>If God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>be glorified by him, God alſo ſhall glorifie him in himſelf.</hi> He cannot doubt of Glory hereafter, who glorifieth God now in this life.
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.</note> For that word ſtands ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt: He that glorifieth me, him I will glorifie: but they that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe me ſhall be diſhonourable. Chriſt did glorifie God by his Doctrine, ſetting him forth by moſt worthy and magnificent Titles. For Believers now call God Father by Chriſt, whom before they lookt on as a Judge under the Law which condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſin. By Chriſt he is called our Saviour, who before was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:171778:83"/> Judge. On the other hand God alſo glorifieth Chriſt, beſtowing great Titles on him, as a Conqueror triumphing over the Law, Curſe, Croſs, Sin, Death, Hell and Satan. This is that Name above every name,
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> which God the Father hath given to Chriſt, at which every knee ſhould bow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the cloſe of this clauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>And ſhall ſtraightway glorifie him:</hi> for preſently, even at the Paſſion he began to glorifie him with Miracles, when the Sun was darkened,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the Centurion and many others knew that he was the Son of God. So while he yet hung upon the Croſs, God heard his prayer for us, which is the greateſt Glory of Chriſt. See now all along how wiſely the
<hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God did ſpeak Before he would ſpeak of his ſuffering and death, he premiſeth his glorifying,
<note place="margin">1.</note>leſt the Diſciples ſhould be too much ſadned;
<note place="margin">2.</note>And leſt they ſhould think him utterly loſt in his Paſſion;
<note place="margin">3.</note>That they alſo in times of adverſity might learn to look at the glory to come, and not ſo much on the preſent miſery.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto he ſpake of his future glory. Now conſequently he begins to ſpeak of his death, but very ſweetly for the comfort of his Diſciples, whom he knew would be exceeding ſorrowfull at his death. For as a good ſon doth not ſo much delight himſelf in the ſucceſſion of a great Inheritance, as not to mourn for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers death: So although the Diſciples were ſure that the death of Chriſt would be of great advantage, and give a large Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet they could not but be much grieved for his death. Therefore he ſpeaks of his death with as ſweet words as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly he could:
<note place="margin">1.</note>And firſt he calls them Children, to ſhew his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly grace of Love toward them.
<note place="margin">2.</note>And withall to ſhew the fruit of his Paſſion; By his Paſſion and Death we have right to be called,
<note place="margin">1 John 3.</note> and to be the ſons of God. Therefore we never read before that he called them children, but now when he was about to ſuffer and die.</p>
                  <p>Nor doth he ſimply call them children, but <hi>little children,</hi> which is a ſign of greater affection, becauſe of the tenderneſs of love, and becauſe as yet they were but weak and tender Babes. They were children when they were grown ſtrong and armed with the Holy Spirit. But now becauſe they were fearfull, and not able to follow their Father, they are called little Children or Babes.
<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> So <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the
<hi>Galatians little children,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:171778:83"/> they were weak in the Faith, and had yet need of milk.</p>
                  <p>But what is it then that Chriſt would ſay to theſe his ſo much beloved little ones? <hi>Yet a little,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I am with you.</hi> And 'twas but a little while indeed, but till he who went forth but juſt now was gone to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and came again with a band of Souldiers and the Prieſts ſervants. He was then preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, condemned to die, and executed, from which time he might ſay, now I ſhall be no longer with you, unleſs I come to ſee you again, and ſtay an hour with you. This he thus ſaid,
<note place="margin">1.</note>That they might more enjoy him whilſt they had him:
<note place="margin">2.</note>And that what he ſpake at his going away might take the deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in their hearts. But it muſt not be ſo underſtood, that Chriſt went away for good and all, and is now no more in the world, when elſwhere he ſaith expreſly: <hi>Lo,
<note place="margin">Matth. 28.</note> I am with you all the dayes,</hi> even to the conſummation of the Age. The meaning then is, yet a little while I am with you, in this viſible and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall body, as hitherto I have been. Henceforth indeed I ſhall be with you, but not as formerly, not viſibly, not mortal, not as a ſtranger in this world, but as a Prince and a Father of that which is to come. And would ye know what ſhall become of you?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek me,</hi> q.d. ye ſhall be ſadly grieved for my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and with great anguiſh and thought of heart ye ſhall ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire my preſence, becauſe both <hi>Jews</hi> and
<hi>Gentiles</hi> will moſt furiouſly abuſe you. At that time ye ſhall ſeeke me and deſire my aſſiſtance. This he ſaith not to affright them, but to prepare their minds for the trouble they ſhould meet with. As a cruel beaſt, if he ſhould ſuddenly ruſh upon a man, would not only terrifie, but tear him, being unarmed and unprovided: but if a man ſee him, and be aware of his coming, he will arm and fit himſelf, ſo that he ſhall do him little or no hurt at all. So when temptations and trials are foreſhewn and foreſeen, they do leſs diſturb and trouble us. Hence ſaith
<hi>David, I made haſt,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Pſal 119.60.</note> 
                     <hi>Paratus ſum, &amp; non ſum turbatus,</hi> ſaith the vulgar reading. I was ready, and not troubled.</p>
                  <p>By this we ſee that the whole life of a Believer in this world is nothing but ſighings, groanings, and a longing deſire after Chriſt. The godly mourn like Doves in this world, and ſay,
<note place="margin">Cant. 5.6.</note> 
                     <hi>My ſoul melted when my beloved ſpake, I ſought him, and found him not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:171778:84"/> And leſt any ſhould ſay, if we ſhall ſpeed no better, why doſt not take us along with thee? It were better for us to go with thee, than be left here behind all alone. <hi>Whither I go,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ye cannot yet come,</hi> q.d. I am going to ſuffer, and ye cannot follow me thither, becauſe of your infirmity. You had need be firſt endowed with power from the High One. Again, I go to the Father, but as yet you cannot follow me thither: for the door is ſhut, I muſt firſt open it for you with the Key of my Death.</p>
                  <p>But what ſhall become of us the while, how ſhall we bear or eſcape the preſent hatred and envy of the world, and be able when the time doth come to follow thee? <hi>A New Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I give you, that ye love one another, as I have lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you,</hi> q.d.

                  <p n="2">2. It is commanded more frequently and more excellently in the New Teſtament. The Sabbath, Sacrifices and Ceremonies are often mentioned in the Law, but Love is every where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the New Teſtament it is otherwiſe laid down than in the Law or old Teſtament. To them it was ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf:</hi> But to us, <hi>As I have loved you;</hi> which is ſomewhat more, for Chriſt loved us more than himſelf. He ſpared not himſelf that he might ſpare us. Therefore it is a New Command, becauſe we are bid love our Neighbour more than our ſelves; ſo that we ſhould prefer nothing before him; neither Honour, nor Riches, no nor our bodily Life; as we ſee in Chriſt that he did not.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Becauſe it is now confirmed by greater Examples,
<hi>viz.</hi> of God and Chriſt. Hence ſaith <hi>John, Herein is Love,</hi>

                     <note place="margin">1 John 4.19. &amp; 3.16.</note> becauſe he firſt loved us, and laid down his life for us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a New Commandment, becauſe he Commands it from the heart, and not from the Ceremonies of the Law: and teacheth that the Law is not fulfilled by outward works, but by the inward love of the heart.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Becauſe though all the other Precepts both ceremonial and judicial are aboliſhed: this only continued and was renewed, not from the nature of the law, which indeed did require it, but gave no power to fulfill it: but from the nature of the Goſpel, which giveth ſtrength by the Spirit to fulfill all the Commandments.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. 'Tis never worn out, it abideth new ſtill, and never waxeth old: for let us love never ſo much, and never ſo long, yet we are ſtill debtors ſo to do.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It is New, becauſe as that which is new is neareſt to its principle or beginning; ſo Charity uniteth and maketh us nigh unto God, who is the beginning of all things.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. Becauſe it cannot be fulfilled but by a New Spirit, or in new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spirit: not by the ſpirit of Bondage, but by the Spirit of Liberty and Adoption: which who ſo hath not,
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> ſhall never fulfill this Command: for by the Spirit alone is Chatity ſhed abroad into our hearts.</p>
                  <p>But mark: Chriſt doth not ſpeak of any kind of love. There

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:171778:85"/> is a carnal love. There is an inordinate love, when we do not only love the perſons and favour them, but their Vices too. Chriſt ſpeaks not of this love, nor of that which conſiſts only in word and in tongue; but of that which is in deed and in truth. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>As I have loved you.</hi> Now Chriſt loved us,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Ordinately, becauſe he loved our perſons; yet ſo as not to flatter our faults, but ſharply reproves them, even in thoſe whom he loves beſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Effectually, not in word only, but in deed. He loved us freely without any merit of ours.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Yea when we were yet enemies: when we were yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son, <hi>Rom.</hi>
5.8,10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Perſeveringly: to the end, as was ſaid before, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. Let us learn from hence how we ought to love our neighbour.</p>
                  <p>But when he ſaith, <hi>As I have loved you:</hi> we muſt not think that he requireth a meaſure every way proportionable to his Love. For who can ſo love? But he would have us do our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, and ſtrive might and main with all our ſtrength to imitate his Love. If we cannot keep pace with him, let us at leaſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low hard after him,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 63.8.</note> and keep as cloſe as may be. As elſwhere he ſaith not, Learn of me to work Miracles,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but Learn of me, becauſe I am meek and lowly in heart: So here, he would not have them known to be his Diſciples by any other Badge, but Love; <hi>Hereby ſhall all men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another.</hi> Chriſtians have other Duties to perform, as to Faſt, Pray, give Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But though theſe things be good, yet a hypocrite may do them, as you read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will have none owned as his Diſciples by any other mark but mutuall Love.
<note place="margin">Matth. 6.</note> For Love is,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A general Note and Sign which every one may have. In the other, as Faſting, Prayer, Almſ-deeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A man may ſometime find an excuſe, but in this none can excuſe himſelf, and find any ſhift to put it by.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is an infallible mark of a godly heart. All other ſigns may fail, but this will never: For where Charity is, there alſo are all other Vertues; and ſo it is the perfect keeping of Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>He that loveth fulfilleth the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="117" facs="tcp:171778:85"/> 3. It is a convertible Sign. As it is true that every true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian loveth his Neighbour: ſo it is true on the contrary, that whoſoever truly loveth his Neighbour is a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Chriſt would have all his known by Charity, and hath given them this for their Livery, that others might be allured and won by the good Odour of the Faithfull, and ſay, <hi>Behold,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 133.</note> how good and pleaſant it is for brethren to dwell in unity.</hi> Whence we ſee,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That Chriſt doth not ſimply require Love of thoſe that are his, but ſo, as without it he will own none for his Diſciple: And if it be ſo, or rather becauſe it is ſo, truly there are but few true Chriſtians to be found in theſe dayes: for Charity almoſt among all men waxeth cold, and faith and mercifulneſs faileth every where, and is withered: inſtead of which, hatred, envy, diſcord, deceit, treachery is ſprung up.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We ſee how much they are out of the way, who would fain be taken for Chriſtians by I know not what Tokens, when Charity towards God and their Neighbour is nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here we find the difference between Faith and Charity. Faith maketh a Diſciple of Chriſt, Charity maketh him known to be a Diſciple. It followeth:</p>
                  <p>Simon Peter <hi>ſaid unto him, Lord, whither goeſt thou?
<note place="margin">John 13.36.</note> Jeſus anſwered him, whither I go, thou canſt not follow me now: but thou ſhalt follow me afterwards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Peter <hi>ſaid unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now?

<note place="margin">verſe 37.</note> I will lay down my life for thy ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus anſwered him, wilt thou lay down thy life for my ſake?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">verſe 38.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Simon, Simon, <hi>Satan hath deſired you,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.31.</note> that he may ſift you as wheat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not;
<note place="margin">verſe 32.</note> and when thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſaid unto him, Lord,
<note place="margin">verſe 33.</note> I am ready to go with thee both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon, and to death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſaid, I tell thee</hi> Peter, <hi>the Cock ſhall not crow this day,
<note place="margin">verſe 34.</note> before that thou ſhalt thrice deny that thou knoweſt me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was a ſign of great fervency in <hi>Peter,</hi> that he only ſhould interrupt Chriſt, and ask his Lord whither he was going, when all the reſt held their peace: ſure he was aſtoniſhed at the word
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:171778:86"/> which Chriſt ſpake: whither I go, ye cannot come; and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he ſhould be ſeparated from Chriſt, he could hold no longer, but muſt needs ask the queſtion. To whom Chriſt very ſweetly anſwered: <hi>Whither I go, thou canſt not follow me now, but thou ſhalt follow me afterwards;</hi> which may be underſtood two wayes:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He could not follow Chriſt to Heaven who was now going thither, but he ſhould follow him afterwards, when he was made a Citizen of the City above, he with the reſt of the Saints ſhould raign with Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He was not yet indued with power from on high, neither had he that ſtrengthening Spirit to reform him and his Nature, therefore he could not ſcorn the dangers of death, nor wholly overcome the terrour thereof.
<note place="margin">1.</note>The power to break the force of death was only in Chriſt. Therefore thou canſt not follow me now, becauſe that to go by the Croſs is yet very hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 77.19.</note> As tis ſaid, <hi>Thy Wayes are in the ſea, and thy Path in the great waters: and thy Foot-ſteps are not known.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Again ſecondly, Thou canſt not follow me yet, becauſe of the imperfection of thy love.
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.</note> There had need be a great fire of Love, which ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waters of afflictions cannot quench; but hereafter when the Spirit ſhall ſhed forth more Love into thy heart, then ſhalt thou follow me.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Laſtly, Thou canſt not follow me yet. It is not in the power of thy carnal will to conquer Death: this it the work of Gods Grace, his Grace alone muſt do it. I muſt firſt ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it by my death, and overcome it. I will grapple with it in my Paſſion, and conquer it by my Reſurrection: Till this be done thou canſt not follow me; thou canſt not but tremble at death. Tis too ſtrong for thee to conquer and contemn. Inded our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhrinks at death, croucheth under it. Our Saviours Paſſion was the firſt diſſolution of Death.
<note place="margin">1.</note>To this end the Son of God did take upon him the ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 2.</note> that by the death of his fleſh he might make Death of none effect, <hi>and might deliver all thoſe who through fear of death were ſubject to bondage.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Again, the contempt of Death had its firſt original from the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> From that very time we may ſay with <hi>Paul, O Death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy Victory? Thanks be to God who hath given us the Victory by Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="119" facs="tcp:171778:86"/> And that <hi>Peter</hi> might not think that he ſhould for ever be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>But thou ſhalt follow me after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> alluding to <hi>Peters</hi> death, and tels him in a Riddle what death he ſhould die, <hi>q.d.</hi> as I will go by the Croſs to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo thou ſhalt follow me by the Croſs. Very truly did Chriſt ſay, <hi>Thou canſt not follow me now,</hi> which thee vent of the matter ſhew'd not long after; When poor feeble <hi>Peter</hi> could not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Lord, but denied him the third time, for fear he ſhould be forced to follow him with the loſs of his own life. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he did follow him, when he ſtretched forth his hands, and was crucified like a worthy Diſciple of his Maſter.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Peter</hi> not well weighing what Chriſt ſaid, and too much truſting to his own ſtrength, doth reply again: <hi>Why,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can I not follow thee now?</hi> q.d. Doſt thou think that I will prove ſo ingratefull for all thy kindneſſes, as to deſert thee? Thou haſt choſen me for one of thy Apoſtles, I had a taſte of the joyes of heaven upon Mount <hi>Tabor,</hi> I have wrought mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles in thy name: indeed what favour haſt thou denied me? how then can I forſake thee at the greateſt pinch of death, when my own life ſhall be never ſo much in danger? Nay, I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage my ſelf, and this I promiſe, I love thee ſo dearly that I will lay down my life for thee, I eſteem ſo much of thy love, that I value not my own life.</p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>Peter,</hi> thou doſt make large promiſes, but thou doſt not well underſtand what thou ſaiſt: thou haſt a good conceit of thy own abilities, but art altogether ignorant of thy weakneſs, thou haſt not yet tryed nor taſted the force of death; if thou hadſt, thou wouldſt not have ſpoken as thou doſt, nor wondred why Chriſt ſaid thou couldſt not follow him now. I know there are examples enough of ſuch as hazarded their lives for their country or kindred, but this proceeded from their carnal affection: But, if God may be Judge, it is not a work of the fleſh but of the Spirit to dye for a ſtranger, or to lay down ones life for his enemies. Yet ſuch is the property of humane rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that it will not acknowledge its own weakneſs. <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould have believed what Chriſt ſaid, and not ſo boldly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted him. Let it be granted that be did it out of his great affection; yet he ought to have believed Chriſt before himſelf, and have thought with himſelf thus: Surely he knows all things,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:171778:87"/> and underſtands better then I what he ſaith: but what doth Chriſt reply to this preſumptuous confidence of
<hi>Peter?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wilt thou lay down thy life for me? <hi>q.d.</hi> What doſt thou mean <hi>Peter?</hi> why doſt thou thus preſume? what thinkeſt thou of thy ſelf? what doſt take thy ſelf to be? wilt thou lay down thy life for me, before I have done ſo for thee? wilt thou under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to conquer death? wilt thou die for me, who came to die firſt for thee? it is my work to overcome death, and not thine. O how ignorant art thou of things to come! how little doſt thou think what will ſhortly come to paſs? this one thing I tell thee before hand, which I would have thee beware of: <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Simon, behold Satan hath deſired you, that he may ſift you as wheat:</hi> know this, I ſay, that the Devil doth lay more traps for you then for all men beſides. His main drift is to tumble and caſt you down headlong, as he did
<hi>Judas:</hi> fain would he hurl you alſo to hell: he doth not ſo much care for others, he is moſt afraid of you; and if he could once get but you into his clutches, he would not doubt to hold you faſt enough for ever: wherefore ſpeak no more ſo exceeding proudly. He hath <hi>Judas</hi> already, and made him his bond-ſlave long ſince, who but a little while ago was himſelf my diſciple as well as any of you: But he cannot content himſelf to hurry one only <hi>Judas</hi> to deſtruction: he doth greedily covet ye all, and uſeth all his wit and wiles by force or fraud to intangle you in his ſnares, and therefore he will tempt you with the ſcandal or offence of my Croſs, to make you abjure and renounce both me and my doctrine. And he is very confident that he ſhall catch you all, having caught one of you already. But through my protection, his wicked devices ſhall be made fruſtrate and come to nought. He ſhall not get ſo much as one of ye into his power, except the Son of perdition, againſt whom he hath lately prevailed. But he will lay wait for thee <hi>Simon,</hi> eſpecially; and as I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd thee to an higher place, ſo he will the more furiouſly aſſault thee. Yea, ſo ſubtilly will he lurk for thee, that I had need make a ſpecial prayer to the Father for thee by thy ſelf. For above all other he will ſet upon thee, if haply he may bring thee into the ſame condition with <hi>Judas,</hi> becauſe thou art more eminent then the reſt. And it is not a little miſchief that he will do thee, but he ſhall not wholly prevail. I have prayed the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:171778:87"/> Father; which if I had not, thou hadſt certainly periſhed and been loſt for ever. But all that he ſhall do now, is to make thee deny my name, he ſhall be able to go no farther, he cannot cauſe thy faith finally to fail. True, thy leaves may fall, but the root ſhall abide ſafe and ſound in thee, which in its ſeaſon ſhall put forth good fruit. I have obtained it for thee by my prayer. But remember this, that when thou ſhalt by my grace be recovered from that thy miſerable and woful fall, that then thou confirm and ſtrengthen the brethren. This is thy part to do as thou art a ſuperiour, to whom in a ſpecial manner I purpoſe to commit the care of my ſheep, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Peter</hi> did not much regard, nor give good heed to the admonition of Chriſt: ſo confident was he then of his own ſtrength: but after his fall he was moſt diligent to do what Chriſt commanded him. Then be did ſtrengthen all penitent ſinners, that they might not deſpair of Gods mercy by reaſon of their ſins. But is it not ſtrange that Chriſt ſhould confer this honour on him, to make him a ſtrengthener of others, who before ſhould deny him, and whom the world would have thought altogether unworthy of any more favour? But Chriſt judgeth not as the world judgeth;
<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> God doth not caſt off any that repent: if the prodigal ſon return, he is reſtored to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dignity.</p>
                  <p>Learn we hence,
<note place="margin">1.</note>that the devil doth project and plot againſt us.
<note place="margin">2.</note>So on the other hand, Chriſt doth take great care of us, and look well to us; the devil doth fight againſt us, Chriſt doth defend us, and intercede for us: Let us beware of one, and run to the other with all our heart. But <hi>Peter</hi> conſidered neither of theſe at that time: but truſting to himſelf more then was meet, he ſpeaks more vehemently: <hi>I am ready to go with thee into priſon, and unto death.</hi> Thou ſpeakeſt well <hi>Peter,</hi> thou canſt give good words, but wouldſt thou endure a priſon and death for Chriſt, who couldſt not bear the leaſt word of his? It ſhould be ſo indeed, that every Chriſtian ought to be always ready, if the caſe ſo require, to die for Chriſt, as it is written: <hi>He that taketh not his Croſs daily and followeth me, he is not worthy of me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 10.</note> But neither <hi>Peter,</hi> nor any man elſe could do this at that time. Afterward when he had received the holy Spirit, he was not able to do this; but really did it, and ſuffered bonds and death
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:171778:88"/> for Chriſt and with Chriſt. Now ſince that Spirit was given, might <hi>Paul</hi> truly ſay,
<note place="margin">Acts 21.</note> 
                     <hi>I am ready not only to be bound, but alſo to die for the name of Jeſus:</hi> which alſo he did perform. Thus ſhould we now ſtand affected: Now is the time that we ſhould go with Chriſt into priſon and unto death. I ſay, we ſhould do that indeed which <hi>Peter</hi> promiſed, but did not do.</p>
                  <p>Now that this confidence and vain boaſting of his own abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties might be kept under and beaten down in <hi>Peter,</hi> when he was come to himſelf again, Chriſt ſets his infirmity before his eyes, and telleth him of his fall before hand, and that with a great aſſeveration and oath: <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, before the cock crow this night, thou ſhalt thrice deny me.</hi> See here what mans glorying comes to, even confuſion. <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved with himſelf, that he would diſcharge the office of faith, and conſtantly follow, &amp;c. Neither did he find that he had any other purpoſe in his heart: but afterward he found it otherwiſe with him, and that he was not now the man he was before. This is the glory of fleſh, which is but as the flower of the field, and the bloſſom of graſs.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 40.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two things we are to take notice of in <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt, His carnal raſhneſs and confidence, with which whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is prickt and puft up, not conſidering the judgements of God, will eaſily miſcarry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, The frailty of the fleſh upon conſideration of Gods judgement. Who was more confident then
<hi>Peter,</hi> before his Lord diſcovered him? Again, who more weak and frail when his Lord condemned him, judged him, and gave ſentence againſt him?
<note place="margin">1.</note>Learn therefore, from
<hi>Peters</hi> fall, to fear God:
<note place="margin">2.</note>And from his repentance, learn to believe and hope, by which only thou wilt be able to ſtand in the evil day.
<note place="margin">3.</note>But by all means, if thou deſireſt to be ſaved, look to it, and take heed thou neither ſay nor think: If <hi>Peter</hi> were not damned for this, no more ſhall I. If his denial did him no hurt, I ſhall be never the worſe for it. We muſt not make the Saints failings our examples to ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>Chriſt in this place doth here check the over-great talkativeneſs of <hi>Peter,</hi> though his big words proceeded from the greatneſs of his Love: warning alſo the reſt, that in times of difficulty or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they truſt not too much to their own ſtrength, but know ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if any thing be done, it is of Divine Grace and gift.</p>

                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:171778:88"/> He doth alſo admoniſh us not to do or promiſe any thing raſhly, but with this condition or limitation, <hi>if the Lord will,</hi>

So it was by the unſearchable counſel of God, that <hi>Peter</hi> eſpecially, the chief among them, ſhould be left for a time to his own infirmity, thrice to fall in denying his Lord that trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Night, when all the Apoſtles were offended, that he might believe by experience, and that we might know that our feet will quickly ſlip if God uphold us not; and if he ſlumber or ſleep, who alone knoweth how, and is able to preſerve us, the Sun will burn us by day, and the Moon by night, <hi>i. e.</hi> in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation we ſhall ſuffer ſhip-wrack of our Faith concerning the Divinity and Humanity of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He did not let <hi>Peter</hi> utterly fall away. At the rebuke of the Lord the waters of temptation flee away, though they ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as high as Mountains. He hath ſet them their bounds which they cannot paſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The joyful news of Chriſts Reſurrection was figured by the Cock-crowing, which was the bound and limit of <hi>Peters</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial: For our Lord riſing again about midnight, awakened the Angels to publiſh his praiſe, and by them ſent the good tidings of his Life and Victory to his ſad Apoſtles. But the ſtumbling-ſtone lay in the Apoſtles way three nights together, before the report of ſo great happineſs came to them. When Chriſt was thrice denied the Cock crew: when the third night of ſcandal was over, then that ſweet ſound was heard of Chriſts Reſurrection. No queſtion but Chriſt would ſtill have the Cock crowing to be a perpetual remembrance to us, to make us walk warily and humbly, leſt we alſo fall.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Note laſtly, that <hi>Peter</hi> held his peace and made no reply to this word of his Lord: the thoughtfulneſs of Treaſon was not yet quite out of his mind, of which Chriſt had ſo lately
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:171778:89"/> ſpoken. We ſhould alwayes ſtand in aw of Gods Word and Judgements. For that is a certain truth: <hi>My words ſhall not paſs away, but ſhall be fulfilled in whomſoever it be.</hi> Thus much of <hi>Peters</hi> admonition. It followeth:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſaid unto them,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.35.</note> when I ſent you without purſe, and ſcrip, and ſhooes, lacked ye any thing? and they ſaid, Nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Then ſaid he unto them,
<note place="margin">verſe 36.</note> but now he that hath a purſe, let him take it, and likewiſe his ſcrip: and he that hath no ſword, let him ſell his garment, and buy one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For I ſay unto you,
<note place="margin">verſe 37.</note> that this that is written, muſt yet be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in me, And he was reckoned among the Tranſgreſſors: for the things concerning me have an end.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they ſaid,
<note place="margin">verſe 38.</note> Lord, behold, here are two ſwords. And he ſaid unto them, it is enough.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words are inſerted by <hi>Luke</hi> only, and they are partly Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatical, whereby Chriſt would make his Diſciples, and us too, confident &amp; bold againſt imminent perſecutions and temptations that compaſs us about. His will is, that they who before had their livelyhood without any care of their own when they preacht the Goſpel among ſtrangers, ſhould now be without fear in preſent tribulations. For God who at firſt took care of them, that they ſhould not want maintenance: he will now take care that none hurt them in the Paſſion of Jeſus, if they have but the ſword of the Spirit about them,
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>i. e.</hi> the Word of God: by which ſword they did afterward break thorow thoſe cruel perſecutions of Tyrants. He that is girt with this ſword of Chriſt, will not ſtand in fear of puniſhment or death. No creature can hurt him that truſteth in God.
<note place="margin">Pſalm 27.1.</note> So the
<hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſingeth. <hi>The Lord is my light and my ſalvation, whom ſhall I fear? the Lord is the ſtrength of my life, of whom ſhall I be afraid?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt had long ſince ſent his Apoſtles to preach the Goſpel in <hi>Judea,</hi> but he ſent them after a new faſhion. Other Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers uſe to provide themſelves a Convoy, Paſport, neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, money and ſhoos above all things: which Chriſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad the Apoſtles to do.
<note place="margin">Matth. 10.</note> They were to go forth without any conduct or ſupply of victuals or money, as if they were not to go among ſtrangers in another Country, but only to their friends and acquaintance. Our Lord thereby teaching both them and us not to diſtruſt Gods care of us, as long as we be in our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:171778:89"/> and about his work. If we be about his buſineſs we ſhall not want ſubſiſtance: His Goſpel and Altar, at which we ſerve will maintain us, though we have nothing of our own. For the Labourer is worthy of his meat. There be thoſe ſtill that will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the Labourers in the Lords Vineyard. Of this new and ſtrange ſending forth of the Apoſtles we read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. <hi>Luke</hi> 9. &amp; 10.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt asked the Apoſtles whither they did lack any thing when they were firſt ſent forth, to make them more confident and couragious from former experience. The Diſciples ingenuouſly confeſs they wanted nothing. Hence Chriſt concludeth that they would need nothing for time to come, but the ſword of Gods Word; and alſo tels them how they ſhould get that ſword.</p>
                  <p>But now he that hath a purſe or a ſcrip, ſaith he, let him take them, let him rip them aſunder and ſell them; and he that hath neither of theſe, let him ſell his coat from his back to get money, but be ſure it be to no other end then to buy a ſword. He will want it hereafter, for there will be wars ſhortly, the enemy is hard by, and muſt be withſtood. A purſe or ſcrip are not wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons for this War: you muſt get a Sword. He doth not mean a material ſword, (he did forbid them that: Nor could one Sword do much in ſo great a hurlyburly,) but a ſpiritual Sword, which is the Lively and effectual Word of God. This is the Sword, that tried Blade that defendeth the Faithfull againſt the Armies of Devil and Hell. He that hath not this Sword, let him buy it. In the Spiritual battel none can ſtand without it. But mony will not, it cannot buy it, tis to be had only by Reſignation and Self denial. The ſpiritual Sword, (ſaith
<hi>Ambroſe</hi>) is to ſell our Patrimony and buy the Word.
<note place="margin">Matth. 13.</note> This is hinted in the Parable of buying the Field and Pearl.</p>
                  <p>The Diſciples did not yet underſtand what Chriſt ſaid. For ſoon after <hi>Peter</hi> fals upon their enemies with his Sword: and here they bring Chriſt two Swords. Now as there Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buketh
<hi>Peter</hi> for ſmiting with the Sword: ſo here he ſaith, <hi>It is enough,</hi> intimating that he did not ſpeak of the material ſword: for what could two ſwords do againſt ſo many enemies? an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred had not been ſufficient. Alas, ſilly Souldiers, what can yee do with your ruſty Swords? We muſt not fight, but ſuffer: and our ſufferings can be conquered by nothing but the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:171778:90"/> But there is a Myſterie in thoſe two Swords which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles brought, and Chriſt ſaid they were ſufficient. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth thoſe two Swords to be the two Teſtaments. But we may underſtand them otherwiſe: one Sword may be the Word of Promiſe, the other the Word of Precept. The Apoſtles had both theſe Swords, with which they ſubdued all the world to Chriſt. To have theſe two Swords, and uſe them well, is enough to obtain everlaſting life. If thou wouldeſt ſtand it out againſt Satan, and ſave thy ſoul, ſtedfaſtly believe all that a Chriſtian ought to believe; and conſtantly practiſe what a Chriſtian ſhould do, and thou ſhalt be ſecure and ſure.</p>
                  <p>But why doth he ſo ſtrictly charge his Apoſtles to ſell their purſe, and ſcrip, and coat to buy this Sword?
<hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that which is written, muſt yet be fulfilled in me: And he was reckoned among the Tranſgreſſors.</hi> There is, ſaith he, a great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation not far off: I your Lord and Maſter ſhall be extreamly diſgraced. For I ſhall not only be named and numbred among the worſt of men, but ſhall be hanged too between two notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and open Thieves. You had need be armed with the Word of God againſt this ſcandal, or elſe yee will hardly continue long in my Faith.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſe this to be ſpoken to us alſo, that we may give all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to arm our ſelves with the Word of God beforehand. For although we have no temptations at preſent, at leaſt very rare and faint ones, yet we muſt look for greater at or before our death, which we ſhall not be able to overcome, except we be armed with the Word of God. This is that which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We wreſtle not againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities, the Rulers of darkneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Stand therefore, having your loins girt about,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi>
6.13,14. Laſtly, he addeth, <hi>For the things concerning me have an end,</hi> i. e. Whatever was written of me will be preſently fulfilled. My ſuffering will fulfill and put an end to all Propheſies. What my Body the Church ſhall ſuffer will alſo have an end. I will ſuffer firſt, the Church ſhall follow me, but not with equal pace or meaſure. Many imitate, but few or none equal the ſufferings of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And he ſaid unto them:
<note place="margin">John 14.1.</note> Let not your heart be troubled: yee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God, believe alſo in me. In my Fathers Houſe are many Manſions.</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>John</hi> the 14, 15, 16, &amp; 17. Chapters.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="127" facs="tcp:171778:90"/> Here the Heavenly mind begins that Sermon which he preacht at Supper, penn'd and left written by none but <hi>John</hi> only, to ſhew that twas not for nothing that he alone leaned on his Lords breaſt.
<note place="margin">1.</note>The firſt thing Chriſt doth handle in this Sermon, is to comfort his Diſciples, who were much caſt down under manifold troubles, as the ſudden ſuffering of Chriſt,
<hi>Judas</hi> his fall, <hi>Peters</hi> danger, and the deſolate condition they themſelves were like to be in very ſhortly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>In this Sermon Chriſt doth manifeſt and open himſelf plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we might know what great good there is to be had in him. If there be never ſo great a Treaſure, we are nothing the better for it ſo long as it is conceal'd and kept cloſe from us. Chriſt had done us no good, if he had not diſcovered himſelf to us by his Word. For we cannot ſee him with our eyes of fleſh. Therefore now he cals himſelf the Fathers equal; Sometime a <hi>Vine;</hi> Sometime the
<hi>Light;</hi> Sometime the <hi>Way, Truth and Life,</hi> &amp;c. All which Names and Appellations diſcover the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great good that is in, and to be had by and from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>Then he concludes his Sermon with Prayer, after he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed all his goods to the Faithfull. For he prayed that they who believed in him might all be Sanctified, that they might be one in him, that his Love might abide in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In which Prayer he was heard in that he feared, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith.
<note place="margin">Heb. 5.</note> And thus much for the Supper of the Lord.</p>

But nothing as yet was actually attempted againſt Chriſt, only he was fairly promiſed to be betrayed, but nothing perfected and put in Execution.</p>
               <p>Chriſt at his laſt Supper had Elegantly expreſſed that Myſtical Attire of the high Prieſt,
<note place="margin">Exod. 28.33.</note> of which we read in
<hi>Exodus: And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath upon the hem of the garment of the high Prieſt</hi> (ſaith the Lord to <hi>Moſes) thou ſhalt make Pomegranates and bells of Gold,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>So ſhall</hi> Aaron <hi>be arrayed in the Office of his Miniſtry,</hi> &amp;c. The skirts of the Prieſts Rayment ſignifie the latter times of our Lords Life: The Pomegranates are his fiery works of Charity, which
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:171778:91"/> he ſhewed at his laſt Supper: the Bells are his ſhril-ſounding words of Love, with which he inſtructed and ſet them in good order at that Supper, and with which he intreated the Father for their ſalvation. The Bels of his Doctrine, and the Pomegranates of his works thus intermixt, make nothing more beautiful to the eye, nothing more pleaſant to the ear, nothing more deſirable or delightfull to be experimented.</p>
               <p>Having now ſeen the beauty of the Pomegranates, and lately heard the ſweet Muſick of the tinkling Bels:
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.</note> Next let us attend and ſee how that high Prieſt entred in, and ſtood in the preſence of God, with the order of his Oblation, how he offered up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God. Firſt then
<hi>John</hi> affirmeth that he ſaid,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">John 14.31.</note>
                  <hi>Ariſe, let us go hence.</hi> By which word,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He would fix it in his Diſciples hearts, that he was to ſuffer ſomething which he knew beforehand, and was willing to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſhewed that he feared not the Devil, though he be the Prince of the world: nor Death, than which nothing ſeems more terrible. Let others, ſaith he, ſtand in dread of the Devil and Death: but let us undauntedly meet both, and look them in the face without fear. They ſhall meet with their match, and find one that is too ſtrong for them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt would have his Apoſtles to be preſent Spectators of his Paſſion, as long as their humane frailty was able to ſtay and endure it, that they might the better be believed. Therefore
<hi>John</hi> ſaith more than once: <hi>He that ſaw it, bare record,
<note place="margin">John 19.</note> and we know that his record,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He exhorted them to get thence with him, becauſe he foreſaw what danger they would be in if they tarried there any longer. For if they had ſtaid in the houſe till the enemy had come upon them, the Apoſtles could have had no way of eſcape: beſides the good man of the houſe might have been brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to great trouble for harbouring ſuch gueſts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He ſheweth that the Apoſtles muſt paſs the ſame way to the Father, which he was to go before them.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Laſtly, He would put them in mind that it was now high time to raiſe up their minds from earthly affections to Heavenly, from corporal things to Spiritual, from worldly and temporary thoughts and matters to Eternal. The meaning then is; ſit up, ariſe, leave the Legal and typical ſupper for the Evangelical.
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:171778:92"/> Yee have ſat long enough already, and too long ſerving under ſhadows: 'Tis ſufficient that ſin hath raigned ſo long as it hath: It ſufficeth to have been ſo long under the tyrannie of the Devil. But now all things ſhall be turned topſie turvy, and changed to the clean contrary. Riſe therefore, let us be gone hence: yee have ſat ſtill and heard the Word, Now ariſe and do the work, come, let's go. Your feet be waſht, take heed you foul them not again.

Let not the roughneſs of the way diſhearten us: our trouble and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be over in a moment, and Eternity ſo long lookt for will come at laſt. In ſhort, Chriſt doth here ſtir up and awaken not only ſuch as lye ſtill and ſleep in their ſins, but thoſe alſo that are laſie, and idle, and make no haſte to forſake ſin: True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity will endure neither of theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Note here, that Chriſt doth not ſay, Let

               <p>
                  <hi>And when they had ſung an Hymn (Jeſus went forth and paſſed over the brook</hi> Cedron (John 18.1.)
<note place="margin">Mat. 14.26.</note>

               <p>

               </p>
               <p>Chriſt had often ſaid that he would ſuffer for us: now he makes it good, voluntarily going to the place well known to the Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and fit for a ſurpriſal.</p>
               <p>But before he went out of the houſe he firſt ſung an Hymn, that he might both ſhew forth the goodneſs of God, and give him thanks after meat: but chiefly for that Spiritual Food, the Euchariſt. In the Maſs or Church-liturgy eſpecially, we are to ſay and ſing thanks and praiſes unto God. And this our Fathers of old did diligently obſerve; and ſome of them compoſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny excellent Hymns, with which I wiſh we could content our ſelves, and not ſo giddily run after every new fangled and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart invention, in contempt of the old and ancient ſervice.</p>
               <p>Now when Chriſt had given thanks and ſung an Hymn to God the Father, for his mercies paſt and to come, (beginning his Paſſion with Prayer, for our Example) He the Light of the world went out of that unhappy and miſerable City <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> in the end of the day he put out the Light of that miſerable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the ſetting Sun left them in a perpetual night of Darkneſs. Thus was fulfilled that which was foretold by the Prophet
<hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> long ſince. <hi>I have forſaken mine houſe,
<note place="margin">Jer. 12.7. Mat. 23.38.</note> I have left mine heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</hi> Alſo by himſelf, <hi>your houſe ſhall be left unto you deſolate.</hi> This outgoing of Chriſt foreſhewed the deſolation of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and City. It was now time to aboliſh that carnal Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to inſtitute the true Worſhip of God, which is in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and Truth,
<hi>John</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>The wickedneſs of the <hi>Jews</hi> deſerved that God ſhould have forſaken them long before. What therefore he had long ſince threatened, he doth now actually declare by that his egreſs and departing out of their City. Although they made little account then of Chriſts preſence, and ſuſpected little loſs by his going forth from them, but rather heartily wiſhed for his abſence, that by any means he might be taken out of their ſight, yet 'twas not long before they were ſenſible with a witneſs, that
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:171778:93"/> with him they loſt all other good beſides. For it is reported that before <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was taken, there was a voyce heard in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<note place="margin">Migremus hinc.</note> ſaying, <hi>Let us be gone hence;</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifieth. So that afterward they cryed, but there was none to hear them. The world ſtill eſteems the loſs of Chriſt the leaſt damage, but they will one day find it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Whereas Chriſt and the Apoſtles went forth together, it fore ſhewed their loſs of God and the Prophets. Wretched City in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that hath neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles left them.</p>
               <p>Chriſt being now about to finiſh his Sacrifice, doth very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly depart and go out from among them; teaching us to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from the tumult when we go to Prayer, as it is ſaid, <hi>He ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth alone and keepeth ſilence,
<note place="margin">Lam. 3.28.</note> becauſe he beareth, or lifteth himſelf above himſelf,</hi> (ſo the vulg. Lat. read it.) And as it is in <hi>Hoſea, I will allure her,
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2.14.</note> and bring her into the Wilderneſs, and ſpeak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to her.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Evangeliſts do very ſignificantly ſet down both the way and place of this departure. The way was over the brook <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron.</hi> The valley between <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and mount <hi>Olivet</hi> was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Kidron:</hi> and the river which runs there was called by the ſame name. This ſwift ſtream did fitly figure out the trouble of the paſſion. For as a brook after much rain runs with great violence, but quickly ceaſeth as the water faileth: ſo temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons aſſault a man with a furious onſet, as though they would preſently ſwallow him up,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.1.</note> as <hi>David</hi> cryeth out: <hi>Save me, O Lord, for the waters are come in unto my ſoul.</hi> But it laſts not long:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 2 Sam. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>For God is faithful, who will not ſuffer us to be tempted above what we are able.</hi> This torrent <hi>David</hi> alſo paſſed over in ſorrow and ſadneſs, when he fled from his ſon. And this brook Chriſt paſſeth over twice. Firſt, In his own perſon. Secondly, In his members. This way muſt we follow Chriſt. Nor let us diſtruſt or doubt any thing: For infinite wealth lieth in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this rough and troubleſom river.
<note place="margin">Gen. 26. Num. 13.23. 1 Kings 15.23. &amp; 2 Kin. 23.6,12.</note> Here <hi>Iſaac</hi> digged and found living water. Here the Spies cut down a bunch of grapes and brought them to the tents of
<hi>Iſrael.</hi> In this brook <hi>Ezekias</hi> did burn the Idols of the houſe of <hi>Judah.</hi> Thus the living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of comfort, and the heart-rejoycing food is found in the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of tribulation. For tribulation bringeth forth moſt excellent fruit in us. It ſetteth on fire, and burneth all vice in us, as fire purgeth and purifieth gold.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:171778:93"/> The place which Chriſt went unto was mount <hi>Olivet.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 1.12.</note> For there he compleated his glory by his aſcenſion: in that mount therefore he prevented, or made way unto that his glory by prayer, and there alſo he began his agony. Or thus, he went out to the mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> becauſe out of great grace and meer mercy (which the Olive ſignifieth) he ſubjected himſelf to ſuffer and die. Or, he went to the mount of <hi>Olives,</hi> to ſhew that the Croſs ſhould become very fruitful, in that man offered himſelf to God not ſadly or by conſtraint, but freely and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. Oyl ſignifieth gladneſs.
<hi>When thou faſteſt,
<note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> anoint with oyl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Evangeliſt addeth, that Chriſt oft-times reſorted thither. Whence obſerve,
<note place="margin">Obſervation.</note> That Chriſt ſpent many nights abroad in prayer. By day he taught and took pains in the Temple; by night he continued praying in mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> ſerving us in both places, leaving us an example in both, though we imitate him in neither. For we labour not in the Temple, but in the Tavern: welabour indeed by night, not in prayer, but in chambering and wantonneſs.</p>
               <p>Further, the Evangeliſts ſay, that he went not out alone, but with his Diſciples. For (as was ſaid before) he would have them be ſpectators of his Paſſion, that they might teſtifie all things more certainly, and that they might the better undergo their own ſufferings afterwards by his example. It is elegantly expreſt in <hi>Luke</hi> that his Diſciples followed him. They followed indeed, but with a heavy heart, fearing and trembling, knowing thoſe words could not be recal'd which that Maſter of all Truth told them before in that night, when he ſaid, that he ſhould be numbered with Tranſgreſſors. They followed him therefore as being now about to take their laſt farewell of him, never more to follow him ſo again. So that doubtleſs they went along with much ſorrow, with many tears and ſighs, ſometimes thinking one thing, ſometimes another, whilſt their grief encreaſed for ſo pious a Paſtor, Father and Maſter.</p>
               <p>It is to be obſerved,
<note place="margin">Luke 10.</note> that at other times the Diſciples went before Chriſt, but when he went to ſuffer they could not go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but followed him. Nature trembleth at the Croſs, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore followeth here very heavily. But the Croſs could not ſtay them when Chriſt led the way. Do but follow Chriſt to the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:171778:94"/> Croſs, and thou ſhalt follow him to Glory. As his ſufferings abound in us,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.</note> ſo his conſolations abound much more.</p>
               <p>But did Chriſt go along with his Diſciples, and ſay nothing to them? No doubtleſs. He often repeated and inculcated that the time of his ſuffering was at hand. This was the time to ſpeak to and admoniſh them, when ſo great a temptation was ſo near.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Verily,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I ſay unto you, All yee ſhall be offended,</hi> &amp;c. whereby he ſheweth that they ſhould be ſo much offended and troubled at his Paſſion, that they would forget whatſoever they had heard and ſeen of him, and now think of nothing but which way to eſcape and ſave themſelves. Although he had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by ſeveral wayes of comfort at his laſt Supper to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent this offence, yet he knew that he could work nothing upon thoſe ſimple ignorant men, and all becauſe the Spirit was not yet given,
<note place="margin">The ſenſe of the words. John 7.</note> nor was Jeſus yet glorified. The meaning then is: <hi>All yee ſhall be offended,</hi> &amp;c. as if he had ſaid, when ye ſhall ſee me taken, bound, drag'd, kild, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And that I do no more Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, nor defend my ſelf, then yee will doubt: yee will think my promiſes were but pretences; and that my Miracles were but Magical. A carnal man will but ſcoff at Chriſt when he ſeeth all men forſake him.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> For the Croſs of Chriſt is fooliſhneſs to them that believe not. But we are not to look ſo much at the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of fleſh,
<note place="margin">John 3.</note> as at the will of the Father, who ſo loved the world that he gave his Son.</p>
               <p>Hence we learn what a hard matter it is not to be offended in times of temptation.
<note place="margin">Matth. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Bleſſed is he,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that ſhall not be offended in me.</hi> 'Tis no wonder to hear men in proſperity ſay, and boaſt that God is their Father; but tis a rare thing to find this Faith in adverſity. When God puniſheth, afflicteth, and forſaketh a man. When the Apoſtles ſaw Chriſt work ſuch Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, no marvel to hear them ſay, <hi>Thou art Chriſt the Son of God.</hi> But to believe that he was the Son of God when he was thus ſurpriz'd, jeer'd, ſlain, this had been courage indeed, but here they ſunk that ſeemed to be Pillars.</p>
               <p>That the Apoſtles might know that this word of Chriſt was agreeable to the Word of God; he alleadgeth that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Zachary,
<note place="margin">Zach. 13.7. <hi>Virum cohae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentem mihi.</hi>
                     </note> It is written,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will ſmite the Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,</hi> &amp;c. In the Prophet it is thus: <hi>Awake, O ſword upon my ſhepheard, and upon the man that cleaveth to me,</hi> ſaith the Lord
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:171778:94"/> of Hoſts, <hi>ſmite the ſhepheard, and the ſheep ſhall be ſcattered,</hi> &amp;c. they are the words of God the Father ſpeaking (by a <hi>proſopopaeia</hi>) to his Sword,
<hi>i.e.</hi> The wrothfull and mad Troop of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who were armed with Swords and weapons of War to aſſault Chriſt when his time was come,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is not ſpoken by way of command, but Propheſie. Let us diſtinctly conſider the words of the Prophet.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt he ſpeaketh to the Sword, and commands it to ſmite. The Sword cannot ſtrike Chriſt nor any Chriſtian, unleſs God command or permit it. So Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Pilate, Thou couldeſt have no power againſt me, except it were given thee from above, John</hi> 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He calleth Chriſt a <hi>Shepheard.</hi> For he is that one and only Shepheard which God promiſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God doth not call him a Shepheard only, but the man which is his fellow: by whom his Divine Nature is touched by the Humane. For the Son is next of all to the Father, he is one with him, and altogether of the ſame ſubſtance; and this none of the <hi>Jews</hi> could deny.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, The Prophet foretelleth the offence of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: The ſheep ſhall be ſcattered: for what can they do when their Shepheard is ſmitten?</p>
               <p>Chriſt did not a little affright the Apoſtles with theſe words, which fear alſo was much aggravated by the night; but leſt they ſhould be ſwallowed up of overmuch ſorrow, he doth comfort them withall. Thus Chriſt ſuffers thoſe that are his to be tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet will he not let them be wholly overcome. And that he may ſolace them with the greater conſolation, he foretelleth his Reſurrection: thereby intending to comfort them again, whom the thoughts of his death before had made ſad; his death being a Token of Gods chaſtiſement for our ſins.
<note place="margin">Rom 4.</note> 
                  <hi>But he was raiſed for our juſtification.</hi> The meaning then is, as if he had ſaid: It was, as yee hear, long ſince, even from Eternity concluded in the counſel of God, that I the Shepheard of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be ſlain for the ſalvation of men: and therefore I do moſt willingly yield my ſelf to ſuffer. It was alſo concluded in the ſame coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of God, that I ſhould riſe again. As ſoon as ever this ſhall be accompliſhed, I will be with you in
<hi>Galilee:</hi> yea more than that, I will be there ſooner than yee, that I may gather my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:171778:95"/> ſheep together. Take this for a Truth, and believe it,
<note place="margin">Matth. 18. Mark 16.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo indeed it came to paſs, as appeareth in <hi>Matthew</hi> and
<hi>Mark.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How great was he that had power to lay down his life, and to take it up again?
<note place="margin">John 10.</note> The firſt ſhewed his Humanity, the other his Divinity. His humanity in that he dyed, his Divinity in that he roſe from the dead. He could die, and he could live again: he could be buried, and he could riſe again. In the one he was like unto us, in the other he was not, although as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We alſo ſhall riſe again in our own order; but not of our ſelves, but of the Lord,</hi> 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>Now when proud <hi>Peter</hi> heard this, he was again pufft up with the vain confidence of his own ſtrength, he anſwereth again, and promiſeth great matters. Shall I, (ſaith he) ever diſtruſt thee, deſert thee, be offended at thee? Shall I be afraid to lay down my life for thee, to die with thee? I perceive, Lord, that thou doſt lightly eſteem my known and approved Faith. Thou doſt not know how highly I value thee. But be thou ſure of this; that if all thoſe my fellow-Brethren, nay if all the world ſhould be offended at thee, yet will I never be offended. Here is mans great preſumption of himſelf, though man be nothing but very meer vanity it ſelf. What doſt mean <hi>Peter?</hi> art not aſhamed of this thy boaſting? why doſt truſt ſo much to thy own ſtrength? doſt not hear Chriſt contradict thee, who doth know thee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than thou doſt thy ſelf? If thou doſt eſteem Chriſt at ſuch a rate, why doſt not believe him, and hold thy peace? Didſt thou ever find him falſe? But his heat of Faith and ardent affection made <hi>Peter</hi> forget both the frailty of his own fleſh, and the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſts words.</p>
               <p>The ſame affection alſo emboldened the other Diſciples to all conſtancy of ſervice by an undaunted reſolution of Faith. Nor doth the Lord ſay any thing to the reſt of the Diſciples, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts their good will, and takes it in good part. But he tels <hi>Peter</hi> again of his fall in the ſame words he did before, that he might not ſay he was not warned beforehand, but might become more wary for the time to come. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto thee,</hi> &amp;c. Gods Word doth ever tend to the humbling and beating down our vain boaſting in our own ſtrength.
<note place="margin">Jer. 17.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Curſed be the man that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth fleſh his arm,</hi> &amp;c. There is nothing more dangerous than
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:171778:95"/> this vain kind of confidence, which yet is ſo rooted in our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it can hardly be rooted out. There be but few that with <hi>David</hi> can truly ſay from their heart, <hi>I will love thee, O Lord,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 18.</note> my ſtrength, the Lord is my Rock,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Hence it was that the more <hi>Peter</hi> was warned of his own weakneſs, the more pertinaciouſly did he perſiſt in his preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<hi>But he ſpake the more vehemently;</hi> Yea though I ſhould die,
<hi>&amp;c. Peter</hi> is here a figure of thoſe who preſume that they can go through all afflictions, and death it ſelf without aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Gods Grace. Theſe ſurely blaſpheme againſt God, and ſeek to make him a lyar; nor are they able to ſtand to their own Reſolutions. Thus
<hi>Peter,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He ſaid that he would break thorow ſtone walls, and go thorow fire and water with Chriſt, and all in his own ſtrength.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When Chriſt reproved his raſhneſs, he blaſphemed, and would have made Chriſt a lyar. Thus it befals all thoſe that will undertake to do any thing without the help of Grace. So true is that of Chriſt, <hi>Without me yee can do nothing. It is God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 15. Phil. 2.</note> ſaith <hi>Paul, that worketh in us to will and to do,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the Apoſtles for our admonition. Chriſt let his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles fall fowly, that if we have fallen, we might not deſpair. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> fell, that afterward he might deal more gently with the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God. Therefore it was ſaid to him, <hi>when thou art convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrengthen thy brethren.</hi> It follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then cometh Jeſus with them unto a place called</hi> Gethſemane.
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.36. John 18.1. verſe 2.</note>
                  <hi>Where was a garden into the which he entred, and his Diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Judas <hi>alſo which betrayed him knew the place; for Jeſus oft-times reſorted thither with his Diſciples.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſaid unto his Diſciples, ſit yee here,
<note place="margin">Matth. ibid.</note> while I go and pray jonder.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We heard before the egreſs of Chriſt out of
<hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> here we have his progreſs. He came to the Village
<hi>Gethſemane;</hi> which is by interpretation the Vale of farneſs, by reaſon of the abundance of Olives that grew there. Here was a garden into which Jeſus entred, that he might begin to make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in a garden, as ſin was firſt committed in the Garden of Paradiſe. For when
<hi>Adam</hi> abuſed his liberty, or rather the leave which was given him in that garden, be then delivered us up captives to Satan, and to all manner of evil, (for to what miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:171778:96"/> is not man now expoſed?) it was moſt fit that Chriſt by his captivity in the Garden ſhould free us from our capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.</p>
               <p>Compare what was firſt done in Paradiſe, with what is here done.
<note place="margin">1.</note>In the garden of Paradiſe
<hi>Adam</hi> became diſobedient: in this garden Chriſt obeyed unto bonds.
<note place="margin">2.</note>There <hi>Adam</hi> merited bondage by his Liberty; here Chriſt recovered liberty by his bonds.
<note place="margin">3.</note>There he pronounced the ſentence of condemnation againſt man: here doth compaſſionately take the ſame ſentence upon himſelf. That ſo we may ſee how that Mercy exalts it ſelf above Judgement, and that his Mercies are over all his works,
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 145.</p>
               <p>But leſt any man ſhould think that Chriſt deſired the privacy of a garden, that ſo he might the better eſcape and hide himſelf,
<hi>John</hi> ſaith, that the Traytor knew this very place well enough, as that into which Chriſt often reſorted. It might have been a great advantage of his ſalvation to this wretched man, that he knew where Jeſus was and might be found: for elſe why doth the Spouſe deſire;
<note place="margin">Cant. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Shew me,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>where thou feedeſt, and where thou lyeſt down, O thou whom my ſoul loveth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this miſerable man moſt abominably abuſing this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to his own deſtruction, became ſo much more wicked than all other men, as the Serpent was more ſubtil than the reſt of the creatures:
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.</note> and for this cauſe he became a more convenient catch-pole for the Devil the deſtroyer of mankind, as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was the moſt proper lurking place for the ſame Devil to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the firſt man. For as then the Devil made uſe of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to deſtroy the earthy man in his ſoul; ſo now he employed this Traytor to kill the new and Heavenly man in his body. And as there the Serpent being the Devils inſtrument was curſt above all creatures: ſo here <hi>Judas</hi> for the ſame reaſon became obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to moſt grievous maledictions, as hath been ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
               <p>Obſerve further, that Chriſt with his Diſciples often reſorted to this garden. Our Lord was wont to chuſe ſolitary and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate places, eſpecially when he had any Myſterie to impart. A retired place is moſt fit for prayer and inſtruction. Here we learn that Chriſt prayed often,
<note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> as alſo he commandeth us to do likewiſe. He did not ſeek privacy for his own part, (for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:171778:96"/> could diſturb him) but for our example, as he ſaith elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>When thou prayeſt, enter into thy cloſet.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas he with his Diſciples frequented no place like the garden; it ſheweth that he delighteth in the flouriſhing growth of Vertue, and the fruit of Grace and Faith: there he doth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly abide, and may be found. But not ſo, where all things wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and are unfruitfull, ſuch as was that barren Synagogue, which he curſed under the Type of the fruitleſs fig-tree.
<note place="margin">Matth. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Let no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When he came to the garden he commanded his Diſciples to ſit ſtill, <hi>i. e.</hi> to be quiet and not troubled in mind, not to be diſquieted at thoſe things which ſhould befall him. He bids them ſtay till he had prayed alone for them all, and for all others; for his prayer is our Redemption. It followeth,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he took with him</hi> Peter, <hi>and</hi> James,
<hi>and</hi> John,
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.37. Mar. 14.33. Luke 22.40.</note>
                  <hi>the two ſons of</hi> Zebedee, <hi>and he began to be amazed, ſorrowfull, and very heavy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And ſaith unto them, my ſoul is exceeding ſorrowfull unto death: tarry yee here and watch with me, and pray, that ye enter not into temptation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he went forward a little, and was withdrawn from them about a ſtones caſt, and he kneeled down, fell on his face upon the ground, and prayed, that if it were poſſible, the hour might paſs from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſaid, Abba Father, All things are poſſible unto thee, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me, nevertheleſs not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From theſe words we way plainly perceive, that this was not a garden of ſolace to Chriſt, but of greateſt ſorrow. Here Chriſt began to give up himſelf to ſufferings; here he opened the door to terrours and horrours. Now the Godhead withdrew its ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Rayes, and the meek and moſt innocent humanity was left to it ſelf. For there were two things in Chriſt moſt different one from the other, to wit, the Divine Majeſty, than which nothing is more Sublime; and the humane weakneſs, than which nothing is more low and abject. Now becauſe he had given ſome taſte of his Sublimity to theſe three Apoſtles in his Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration,
<note place="margin">Matth. 17.</note> he would have them alſo to be witneſſes of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great abaſement, that thereby they might learn what they were to follow after, and what they might expect. They
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:171778:97"/> had ſeen his glory in the Mount, now they ſee his ſorrow in the garden; from <hi>that</hi> they had proof of his Divinity, by <hi>this</hi> they were fully aſſured of his humanity, that afterward they might give clear Teſtimony of both. The Lord knew that there would Hereticks ariſe, who out of their wanton brain would affirm, that he did not ſuffer really and indeed, but only held out an image or figure of ſorrow and ſuffering, as <hi>Manichaeus</hi> that wicked man forged of him. Wherefore that he might clear it to all Ages that he did not fantaſtically, but truly grieve for us, and endured a moſt bitter Paſſion for us, he makes it appear by moſt evident ſigns; to wit, ſorrow, fear, long prayer, Angelical Conſolation, and ſweat of blood. To this agreeth that of
<hi>Iſaiah, Surely he hath born our griefs,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53. Pſalm 88.3.</note> and carried our ſo rows.</hi> So in the <hi>Pſalms, Repleta eſt malis anima mea, my ſoul is full of troubles:</hi> He doth not ſay of Vice and Sin, but of humane evils, <hi>i. e.</hi> my ſoul is full of grief and anguiſh. For in that he took upon him the whole man with his natural conditions, he muſt needs have natural ſadneſs and vexation.
<note place="margin">Chriſtus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus nobis contulerat, ſi non noſtrum ſuſcepiſſet. affectum.</note> Hence ſaith
<hi>Ambroſe,</hi> Chriſt had not done us ſo much good, if he had not taken our affections upon him. Nor was he deluſively incarnate, but truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo. How elſe could we follow him, if not as a man, if we believe not that he dyed, if we had not ſeen his Wounds? Or how ſhould the very Diſciples themſelves have believed that he dyed indeed, if they had not ſeen his ſorrows before his Death, and that by plain and manifeſt Tokens.</p>
               <p>Yet did he not ſhew this his ſorrow to all the Diſciples, leſt his weakneſs ſhould offend them more then they could bear. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he lets theſe three only ſee it, who had before beheld his Divinity. Theſe could not be ſo much troubled at it, at leaſt they ought not, but ſhould rather remember the glory they had ſeen before.</p>
               <p>Concerning this extraordinary ſorrow of the Lord Chriſt, ſo exactly ſet down, many men have written many things, and have variouſly contended about it, but for our part we ſhall give cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit only to the bare words of the <hi>Evangeliſts.</hi> For no man can affirm that it was more than a humane and natural ſorrow, which may alſo befall us in greateſt ſtreights and miſery. For the Humanity which Chriſt aſſumed could neither be without ſuch affections, nor be believed by the world. He had not been
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:171778:97"/> a true man, if his nature had not trembled at death.</p>
               <p>This ſorrow of Chriſt is by <hi>Matthew</hi> and
<hi>Mark</hi> expreſt by three words: The firſt is ſorrow, which the Greek cals <hi>Lipe,</hi> whereby the ſadneſs and trouble of the mind is expreſt. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is <hi>Fear,</hi> which in the Greek is
<hi>Thambos.</hi> The third is moſt ſore Amazement, which in Greek is
<hi>Ademonia.</hi> To theſe <hi>Luke</hi> adds a fourth, <hi>viz.</hi> Agony, of which anon. Thus thoſe three Diſciples ſaw here a far other thing than what they ſaw on Mount <hi>Tabor.</hi> For here the Father is not heard to ſpeak:
<note place="margin">Matth. 17.</note> The Light doth not ſhine from Heaven: His Face doth not glitter like the Sun: His Rayment is not whiter than ſnow: <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> talk not with him. But as a man altogether deſtitute of any help, he begins to fear, to be weary of his life, and to be ſore troubled, greatly bemoaning himſelf, as they who are but meer men uſe to do when ſuch a diſmall ſtorm of trouble hangs over them.</p>
               <p>And this is that which Chriſt himſelf foretold:
<note place="margin">Luke 12.</note> 
                  <hi>I have a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm to be baptized with, and how am I ſtreightened till it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed?</hi> Therefore now he ſaith, <hi>My ſoul is ſorrowfull even unto death.</hi> A moſt Heavenly word, worthy of all obſervation. For here we ſee what it is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Who being in the form,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Phil. 2.</note> that is, in the Wiſdom, Power, Majeſty, glory of God, <hi>he made himſelf of no reputation.</hi> How could he more deeply a baſe and humble himſelf than to be made like unto us in all things,
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> yea to be made a curſe for us? The fear of death is the fruit of infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and ſin, and a part of the firſt malediction. For although Chriſt was altogether without ſin, yet he transfer'd the wages of ſin upon him, not that we ſhould never have a ſenſe thereof, but that he might overcome and triumph over the ſame, and that he might teach us how to be able in him to overcome all evil by Faith. He was tempted like us, yet without ſin,
<note place="margin">Heb. 4.</note> that he might be able to have compaſſion on us. So that as often as we are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet with the fear of Death, or any other affliction, we may ſafely ſay, <hi>Behold, God is our ſalvation: we will truſt,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 12.3.</note> and not be afraid: for the Lord Jehovah is our ſtrength and ſong, he is our ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that he ſaith, <hi>my ſoul is ſorrowfull unto death:</hi> this may be underſtood two wayes:
<note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt extenſively, in that this ſorrow and anxiety continued even till the ſeparation of the ſoul from the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:171778:98"/> body.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, Intenſively; becauſe it was as great as was poſſible to be in a living man, or than which never any man had greater in this life. And no wonder that his ſorrow was ſo great, ſeeing there were more than one, and they very great cauſes of this his ſorrow. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>He was ſorrowfull and ſore troubled (yet according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, or rather ſenſibility) becauſe he ſaw his near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching Paſſion as it were before his eyes, with all the ſhame and bitterneſs thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>He was ſore troubled and ſorrowfull for the ſins of all men, paſt, preſent, and to come, all which he took upon himſelf. The Lord laid upon him the iniquity of us all,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>He was ſad for the ſins and unthankfulneſs of <hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> whoſe life, glory, and ſalvation was in danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>He was troubled for the fall and ſcattering of his Diſciples and other friends, and moſt for the deſolate ſtate of his holy Mother.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note>Laſtly, He was ſorrowfull for the ingratitude that would be found in Chriſtians in time to come. He ſaw that his Paſſion would be unprofitable to many men. He ſaw alſo that many Chriſtians would forget him, as one dead in their hearts, and quite out of mind, and that very few would be thankfull to him for ſo great a benefit,
<note place="margin">Pſalm. 109.</note> but rather with a baſe requitall would render him evil for his good. See what great cauſe he had to be ſorrowfull. Well then might he ſay, My ſoul is ſorrowfull un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death. This is that which he foretold by <hi>David</hi> long ſince: <hi>My bones are vexed:
<note place="margin">Pſalm 6. Pſalm 55.</note> my ſoul alſo is ſore vexed.</hi> Again, <hi>Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and trembling are come upon me, and horrour hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed me, my heart is ſore pained within me: and the terrours of death are fallen upon me.</hi> See what fit Plaiſters Chriſt doth apply to our wounds. Sin is born in the heart, (luſt bringeth forth ſin) and brought up in act,
<note place="margin">James 1.</note> and ſo finiſhed: So Chriſt was firſt inwardly ſorrowfull, and then outwardly, that he might to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally take away all ſin, and make full ſatisfaction for us.</p>
               <p>What then doth Chriſt do in this his ſtreight? Why, juſt like thoſe that are ſuddenly ſurpriz'd with ſome great amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he deſireth thoſe three Diſciples to tarry with him, and watch and pray: in which words he doth variouſly expreſs our infirmities. Thoſe that are in miſery, think it no ſmall comfort
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:171778:98"/> to have a friend to whom they may be bold to complain of their miſery.</p>
               <p>Again, It is a comfort to thoſe that are aſtoniſhed and afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if others will but ſtay and ſtand by them. It is the greateſt trouble to be left alone in trouble. This affection Chriſt here expreſſeth.
<note place="margin">Heb. 2.</note> See into what a low condition the Son of God humbled himſelf, and how he would be like unto us his brethren in all things.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs although he chargeth them to watch and ſtand by him, yet he doth not neglect to pray for aid alſo from Heaven, to ſhew that vain is the wiſdom of the fleſh, and that all carnal aſſiſtance is nothing worth, if God be abſent. Therefore he went from them to pray, and commanded them to pray alſo: who doubtleſs could not but hear the dolefull and affectionate cry of his Prayers, though they were at ſome diſtance from him. So that here he taught us both by his Word and Example what to do in times of Temptation, even to have recourſe to God: And not only ſo, but he ſheweth alſo the beſt way of praying. For,
<note place="margin">1.</note>firſt he with-drew from the Apoſtles. <hi>He that will pray, muſt go into his Chamber, Mat.</hi> 6.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, He kneeleth down, yea, falleth on his face. Prayer ought to be made in humility. So much the more humble, ſo much the ſooner it peirceth Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and is heard.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, He doth not pray once only, but often: nor did he give over, till the Angel comforted him. Teaching us thereby to perſevere in prayer.
<note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly, He prayed in aſſurance: therefore he did ſo ſweetly repeat the name of <hi>Father. He that believeth not, let him not think to receive any thing, James</hi> 1.
<note place="margin">5.</note>Fifthly, He committeth all to God. We muſt not preſcribe time or manner unto God.
<note place="margin">6.</note>Laſtly, <hi>Peter, James</hi> and
<hi>John</hi> were not far from him, by whom thoſe three vertues are ſignified, which are neceſſary for every one that prayeth; to wit, Faith by <hi>Peter,</hi> Courage by <hi>James,</hi> and the Grace of God by
<hi>John.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As often then, O Chriſtian, as Satan tempteth thee, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this Garden, and this prayer of Chriſt in the Garden. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the tumults of men, go a little aſide, kneel down, fall on thy face, (for by theſe geſtures the faithfull expreſs the ſervency of their mind, and that they have no hope, counſell or help in the world, but only in God,) open thy mouth, and utter words
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:171778:99"/> from thy heart, lay open thy anguiſh and pain before God with ſighs and ſupplications againſt the violence and wrongs of Satan. Here thy ſorrow and anguiſh of heart will do thee no harm. Yea, though it afflict thy body a little, it will do thy ſoul good. But remember to temper thy prayer ſo, even as Chriſt here did, who in all humility threw himſelf upon the ground, and as man, he reſigned and offered himſelf wholly to the Will of God, that the Father ſhould do with him as he pleaſed. Thou alſo pray for what thou wilt; cry, intreat, make known thy wants: but conclude alway, as here: Not mine, but thy will be done; for thou knoweſt beſt what is good and profitable for me.</p>
               <p>Believe me, our prayer is well accepted, if it be granted to us according to the will of God. The <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> do not without cauſe ſo diligently ſet down this, that Chriſt put the whole event of his Prayer in the will of God. If Chriſt did thus, whoſe will yet was not divided from the will of his Father; nor could he will any thing but what the Father willed: how much more ought we to do ſo, whoſe will moſt commonly is againſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth the will of God? To ſay nothing how pernitious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive for the moſt part it would be to us, if God ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes grant us what we deſire. The will of our fleſh is not good: but that which the Spirit willeth in us cannot be evil, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirit is not evil. Briefly, Let the Prayer of Jeſus be the Form and Pattern of our Prayer. Let him teach us how to pray, as he ſhew'd us how to ſuffer. Let us now weigh the words.</p>
               <p>Firſt he ſaith in the <hi>Chalde</hi> Tongue, <hi>Abba,</hi> which in Latine is as much as <hi>Pater, Father,</hi> and this name he doubleth: It is a great comfort in affliction to believe that God is our Father, and that our troubles come upon us by his good pleaſure.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> So <hi>Paul, when we are judged, we are chaſtened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be condemned with this world.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> Again, <hi>Yee have not yet reſiſted unto blood: and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto you as children;
<note place="margin">Prov. 3.</note> my ſon, deſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He ſaith, <hi>If it be poſſible, and all things are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto thee.</hi> Here none doubteth, but that God (to ſpeak ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely) could have reſtored man ſome other way, than by the death of his Son: but this was the way which from Eternity
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:171778:99"/> was reſolved on; and therefore it muſt be that Chriſt ſhould dye. And it was not without reaſon why God ſhould be beſt pleaſed with that way. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>Divine Juſtice muſt be ſatisfied. We deſerv'd to be puniſht, but God the Father ſet his Son in our ſtead; who could owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon his own ſcore, and therefore might make the fuller ſatisfaction. As the perſon of Chriſt was more pleaſing to God than all other men: ſo his Paſſion merited more than all ours can do.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>God therefore made choyce of this way to redeem mankind, that he might make his power known. For he did not defend Chriſt againſt his ſtrong enemy, yet he overcame him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>That he might make his love ſo much the more manifeſt to us, to provoke our love:
<note place="margin">1 John 4.</note>
                  <hi>In this was his love manifeſt, that he ſent his Son,</hi> &amp;c. Wicked men prate that God took no pains to create them. But here let them conſider that they were not eaſily Redeemed. Chriſt took a great deal of care and pains to make man a great debtor to him in much love, and that he might become more thankfull by the difficulty of his Redemption, who was grown ſo cold in his devotion, becauſe of the eaſineſs of his creation. God made all things, and man among the reſt, in ſix dayes: but he was full three and thirty years working out our Salvation in the midſt of the earth. See how juſtly we may be complained of, who lightly eſteem this greateſt Token of Love; whereby we exceedingly provoke his wrathfull indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt us.</p>
               <p>Whereas Chriſt prayeth that the Cup might paſs from him: by the Cup he meaneth his Paſſion:
<note place="margin">1.</note>For as much drinking makes men drowſie, ſo Chriſts Paſſion made him ſleep in Death.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Or as free drinking makes men jocund, ſo the ſufferings of Chriſt make us above all things moſt cheerfull, in that it brought ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Salvation to us. In this ſenſe the Cup is taken elſwhere, <hi>I will take the Cup of ſalvation,</hi> &amp;c. Again,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 116.</note> 
                  <hi>Can yee drink of the Cup that I ſhall drink of? Mat.</hi> 20.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay, was not Chriſt willing to ſuffer? Or did he ſuffer againſt his will, in that he prayes here againſt the Cup of his Paſſion? Far be it from us ſo to think. How could he be unwilling to ſuffer, who at his laſt Supper ſaid, that the blood of his Body was to be ſhed for the Remiſſion of ſins? <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:171778:100"/> Who alſo ſaid, <hi>I lay down my life for my ſheep,</hi> John 10. And reply'd to <hi>Peter</hi> when he diſſwaded him from ſuffering; <hi>Get thee behind me Satan, for thou ſavoureſt not the things of God, Matth.</hi> 16.</p>
               <p>We ſay that Chriſt did not ſuffer unwillingly, but freely of his own voluntary conſent, as his Prayer concludes: <hi>Thy will be done.</hi> He prayed that if it were poſſible the Cup might paſs from him:
<note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt to ſhew that he was a true man, who by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is afraid of Death. As there are divers affections in man, to wit, of the fleſh, and of the Spirit: ſo Chriſt hath here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers prayers. The fleſh prayeth, and the Spirit prayeth. Chriſt took upon him the prayer of fleſh, as alſo the fear of Death. He did not pray againſt Death, as if he had been afraid to dye: (for how could the Son of God be afraid of Death?) but he prayed according to the deſire of fleſh, that by the prayer of the Spirit he might overcome the prayer of fleſh. The fleſh with a brazen face prayeth againſt the Croſs, nor can it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed deſire and love it: but the Spirit doth correct and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come it.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Or according to the opinion of ſome others, Chriſt therefore prayed, that if it were poſſible the Cup might paſs from him; leſt the condemnation of wicked men ſhould be the greater by reaſon of his Paſſion. <hi>Origen</hi> ſaith, that Jeſus ſaw that <hi>Judas</hi> one of the twelve would become a ſon of perdition by reaſon of the Cup of his Paſſion. On the contrary, he knew that by his Paſſion he ſhould triumph over the gates of Hell: for their ſake therefore whom he would not that they ſhould periſh becauſe of his ſuffering, he ſaith <hi>Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs from me.</hi> But for the ſalvation of mankind, which was to be Redeemed by his Paſſion, he ſaith by way of correcting his former Prayer: Nevertheleſs not mine, but thy will be done. The meaning then of the whole prayer is,
<note place="margin">The ſenſe of the Prayer.</note> as if he had ſaid, O my Father, according to my humane nature I have compaſſion upon the miſerable Synagogue, becauſe theſe chiefly will cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie me, who daily read the Law and the Prophets.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:171778:100"/> that theſe muſt kill me, to whom principally I came from Heaven, and that they ſhould do it to their own Eternal ruine. O my Father, my Father, if there may be any other way found out, whereby man may otherwiſe be relieved, I could wiſh it might be made uſe of: only that this people ſhould not ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably periſh. But I know the Decree of thy will. Therefore not this my will, but thine be done. <hi>I am ready to halt;

Some think that Chriſt thus prayed, if it were poſſible, to the end his Diſciples and all the godly might obtain the inheritance without the Croſs. For ſaith
<hi>Hilary:</hi> He prayeth, that they might get the glory of his Inheritance without undergoing the hardſhip of the ſufferings. Or if indeed they muſt ſuffer, yet it might be without deſpair, without ſenſe of pain, without fear of Death. It follows in the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he cometh unto the Diſciples, and findeth them aſleep,
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.40. Mar. 14.37. Luke 22.46.</note> and ſaith unto</hi> Peter, Simon, <hi>ſleepeſt thou? What, could yee not watch with me one hour? why ſleep yee?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Watch and pray that yee enter not into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the fleſh is weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he went away again the ſecond time, and prayed, ſaying, O my Father, if this Cup may not paſs away from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he came and found them aſleep again: for their eyes were heavy: neither wiſt they what to anſwer him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the third time, ſaying the ſame words, Father, if thou wilt, take away this Cup from me; Nevertheleſs not my will, but thine be done.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt prayed, and that in an humble poſture, and with moſt affectionate words: yet he doth not perceive that he is heard. Do not thou therefore take it amiſs, if thou art not preſently heard, eſpecially when thou prayeſt after the fleſh. Now when Chriſt came to his Diſciples, whom he commanded to pray, he findeth them aſleep: And becauſe they had rather ſleep than pray, the Tempter fell ſo cloſe upon them, that he prevailed, and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:171778:101"/> ſo Chriſts word proved true. Chriſt here might have taken up that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 38.10.</note> My heart panteth, my ſtrength faileth me,</hi> (i. e. the Divinity) <hi>as for the light of mine eyes, it alſo is gone from me, my lovers and my friends</hi> (i. e.
<hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi>) <hi>ſtand aloof from my ſore, and my kinſmen</hi> (i. e. my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) <hi>ſtand afar off, they alſo that ſeek after my life</hi> (i. e. the Devils) <hi>lay ſnares for me.</hi> But although all the Diſciples ſlept, yet he doth ſpecially reprove
<hi>Peter,</hi> becauſe he promiſed more than the reſt: and becauſe drowſineſs doth worſt of all become thoſe that ſhould excell others. Therefore he doth not call him <hi>Peter,</hi> but <hi>Simon,</hi> which was his name formerly: becauſe he that ſleepeth when he is appointed to watch over others, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the name of <hi>Peter.</hi> He is then called
<hi>Peter,</hi> when he confeſſeth Chriſt. <hi>Simon,</hi> ſleepeſt thou? Where is now thy conſtancy? Where is thy promiſe and engagement? Wouldſt thou follow me unto Death, and canſt thou not watch with me one hour? Art thou at laſt ſenſible that the ſons of men are vain, and but a lye?
<note place="margin">Pſalm 62.</note> But God only is true. This he ſaid to <hi>Peter.</hi> Afterward he rebuketh the other Diſciples too. Sloth and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs deſerve to be blamed in all Chriſtians: <hi>Why ſleep yee,</hi> ſaith he, This is not a time to ſleep when danger is ſo near us. <hi>Your adverſary the Devil as a roaring Lion goeth about,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 5.</note> ſeeking whom he may devour.</hi> Here is no ſecurity for you. The pit is digged for you, which ye cannot avoid or eſcape, except yee take my counſell. Watch therefore and be alwayes ready, leſt Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſurprize yee unawares, But this is not all, for no man is able to ſecure himſelf, but by the help of God. Therefore he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther addeth: <hi>And pray, that ye enter not into temptation,</hi> i. e. leſt the Temptation overcome ye. It is impoſſible that mans heart ſhould be free from Temptation: but we are to pray that we be not overcome by Temptations.</p>
               <p>See how gently Chriſt deals with his Diſciples: he might have handled them more roughly: but he alayeth his Rebuke, and as though he were willing to excuſe their ſleepineſs, he ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit truly is willing, but the fleſh is weak. q.d.</hi> I know ye have a willing mind, but the frailty of the fleſh hindreth that willingneſs. The ſpirit is forward to do what it ought to do, but the fleſh is ſlow; it is affected only with thoſe things that are ſuitable to it: it will not willingly watch or pray; it is afraid to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:171778:101"/> ſuffer, it avoideth, is offended at, and denyeth the Croſs. In ſhort, it doth nothing that is good. But contrariwiſe, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is confident and valiant, it doth pray, watch, bear up in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, make a free confeſſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whenſoever the ſpirit is compared with fleſh, it ſignifieth the Holy Spirit, and his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in us. But the fleſh ſignifieth the humane nature, even with its beſt motions, but without the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit. The ſpirit then is willing, becauſe it affecteth thoſe things that are his own, and cheerfully carrieth on to all that is good. But the fleſh is weak, for it will not alway indure the yoak of the ſpirit, as it is written, <hi>The good that I would, that do I not;
<note place="margin">Rom. 7. Gal. 5.</note> but the evil that I would not, that do I. The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, that ye cannot do thoſe things that ye would.</hi> What need I multiply more? If we have a ſpirit ready to do good, yet the weakneſs of our fleſh hindreth, and overcometh it. But if our ſpirit be backward to evil, yet the fleſh will ſtir, and ſpur it forward. Hence it is that <hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> ſlept not, but were moſt vigilant, becauſe they made haſt to evil. But the Apoſtles ſleep, becauſe they were exhorted to good. To conclude, when we are moſt confident of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of our mind, let us ſuſpect then the backwardneſs of our fleſh.</p>
               <p>When he had warned his Diſciples, for whoſe ſake he brake off his Prayer, he went away to pray again, praying almoſt the ſame words which he did before. Thereby giving an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to Preachers: Firſt, ſo go from Prayer to Preaching to inſtruct the people, and from Preaching to return to Prayer. Firſt, Let them pray, that they may be fruitfull and profitable; then let them pray that the fruit be not blaſted. But as Chriſt returned to Prayer, ſo the Diſciples went to ſleep again, ſo that all Admonition was to no purpoſe. Their ſleep now fore-ſhewed that their faith ſhortly would be benighted. But the Evangeliſt ſaith further, for ſome kind of excuſe for this drowſineſs, that ſorrow rather than ſloth made them fall aſleep; <hi>for their eyes,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were heavy,</hi> a thing common to thoſe that are in heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When the heart is ſad, the eye is ſleepy, ſo that men had rather go to bed, than go to eat or drink. And becauſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples were ſleepy and ſorrowfull, they could not tell what to anſwer. And who indeed could excuſe ſuch drowſineſs in ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:171778:102"/> a caſe? <hi>Hamans</hi> frailty did ſtrongly put forth it ſelf in the Apoſtles. Truly, if the Lord with draw, we fall aſleep quickly, although he was with us but little before.
<note place="margin">Mat. 28.</note> Let us pray therefore that he would abide with us unto the end of the world.</p>
               <p>We do not read that Chriſt ſaid any thing to his Apoſtles when he came to them the ſecond time, but ſilently paſſed by their weakneſs, to teach us that we ſhould rather admoniſh our Brethren, and bear with their Infirmities, than ſeverely puniſh, or wholly condemn them. This ſleepineſs did not a little add to Chriſts ſadneſs. For now he ſaw that he ſhould not only be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently aſſaulted by his enemies, but ſhould alſo be forſaken of his deareſt friends. He ſaw that
<hi>Judas</hi> did not ſleep, but watched to do him a miſchief; but his Diſciples were very ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh in that which was good. Whereby theſe our dangerous times were prefigured, which are full of deceit, fraud, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting cares;
<note place="margin">Mat 24.</note> when for the getting of this worlds goods, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Honours, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Iniquity ſo much aboundeth. But all love to Godlineſs is key cold.
<note place="margin">Luke 16.</note> The Children of this world are wiſer and warier in wicked works, than the Children of God are in the works of Godlineſs.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt ſaw that there was little, or no comfort, or aſſiſtance to be expected from the Apoſtles, he goeth back to prayer the third time, and turns himſelf wholly to God, to whom only the <hi>poor is committed.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 10.14. 2 Chron. 20.</note> When we know not what to do, yet this is our comfort, that our eyes are toward Heaven. Here we have an example not to pray once only in Temptation, but thrice, nay ſeven times, that is, very oft. To pray but once, is not to pray at all. To pray often, is to pray effectually. <hi>Peter</hi> denyed thrice, Chriſt prayed three times; it becometh and behoveth us to imitate this, but by all means to avoid the other.</p>
               <p>Whereas Chriſt prayed ſo often, it is moſt manifeſt that it is a hard matter for us to ſtruggle with death. Unexperienced men, like
<hi>Peter,</hi> truſt too much to their own ſtrength. But he that hath tryed theſe things, betaketh himſelf to God; for he ſeeth that the humane nature of it ſelf is too weak. Therefore he committeth all things to God, ſaying, <hi>Thy Will be done,</hi> as if he had ſaid, ſo long as thy Will is done, and I commit my ſelf to thy Will, I can now in thy ſtrength break thorow that which I
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:171778:102"/> could not by my own. Thou wilt not forſake thoſe whom thou calledſt to ſuffer, while they ſtand in aw of thee, and rely upon thee. Thus Chriſt did all theſe things, firſt for our Redemption, then for our example, how to behave our ſelves under the fear of death. It follows in the Text;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there appeared unto him an Angel from Heaven,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.43.</note> ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him. And being in an Agony, he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling down to the ground.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are three things moſt obſervable in theſe words.
<note place="margin">1.</note>Is it not a ſtrange, and a new thing, that an Angel, that a ſervant ſhould comfort Chriſt? But here we ſee that truly fulfilled which <hi>David</hi> propheſied of in the
<hi>Pſalms;
<note place="margin">Pſalm 8.</note> Thou haſt made him a little lower then the Angels.</hi> For as Chriſt was truly tempted, and was ſorrowfull, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo he would be comforted by an Angel like other men, that he might be like his Brethren in all things.
<note place="margin">Heb. 2. Mat. 4.</note> In another place we read that the Angels miniſtred to Chriſt.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, We learn that God doth not forſake thoſe that hope in him. For although he doth not alwayes remove the evil, yet he doth inwardly ſtrengthen, and give power to undergo it.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Laſtly, We are here taught, that the holy Angels ſtand by us when we pray, ſtrengthning us in our prayer, and carefull of our wel-fare, which ſhould ſtir us up to pray more fervently, leſt our ſluggiſhneſs ſhould offend them, and cauſe them to depart from us, and ſo leave us under that ſad complaint,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 88.8.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou haſt put away mine acquaintance far from me, thou haſt made me an abomination to them.</hi> Again, <hi>My kinſ-men ſtand afar off;
<note place="margin">Pſalm 38.</note> they alſo that ſeek my life, lay ſnares for me.</hi> For certainly, if the bleſſed ſpirits ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves from us, we cannot bear the brunt of the evil ſpirits.</p>
               <p>Now leſt any ſhould wonder why Chriſt would ſtand in need of an Angel to ſtrengthen him, <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he was in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony,</hi> that is, he was as it were contending with death. What man, what tongue, what underſtanding is able to comprehend fully this Agony, I ſay not to expreſs it? We ſee with what great perplexity dying men ſtruggle, in whom their ſenſes are almoſt dead already; how much more anguiſh then was there in the heart of Chriſt, whoſe ſenſes were yet moſt lively, who clearly perceived all the horrour of death, and was perfectly ſenſible
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:171778:103"/> thereof? O how hard, ſharp and bitter was it to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in Chriſt? What ſtrugling? what ſtrife? what hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour? Laſtly, What, and how full of Anguiſh was this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption? If thou doubt it, conſider the bloody ſweat on every ſide flowing from his ſacred body. Where didſt thou ever ſee the like? When didſt thou ever hear the like? This greateſt and moſt violent Agony ſqueezed out this ſweat. And if thou doſt mind it well, they were our ſins that preſt out this unuſual ſweat from the Lord Jeſus. All our ſins were hanged about his neck, and laid upon his ſhoulders. Satan endeavoured with all his might utterly to overthrow both him, and his kingdom. Death would not die, yet of neceſſity it muſt come to it. One only Chriſt alone was to combate with all theſe evils, and as ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yea, the true <hi>Hercules,</hi> he was to ſhake off theſe moſt hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and peſtilent miſchiefs from our necks. Nor could any other do this but he. Therefore by how much the greater theſe evils were, ſo much the more pains was there required to overcome them. Yea, ſeeing they were the greateſt evils, there was need of the greateſt labour. This <hi>Luke</hi> ſignifieth, when he ſaith, <hi>He was in an Agony, and did ſweat blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now that Agony of Chriſt ſignifieth nothing elſe,
<note place="margin">Agon, vel A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia.</note> but the fear and dread of our Conſcience before the face or preſence of Gods Judgement. For indeed when the time of Judgement is at hand, the ſoul is toucht with the conſcience of evil: which being touched, the whole ſoul begins to tremble, the whole be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to periſh, when it is ſet ſingle and alone before the eternal and wrathfull Tribunal of God. Of which trembling <hi>Job</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
<note place="margin">Job 9.</note>
                  <hi>If he will contend, who ſhall anſwer him?</hi> This Trembling is alſo ſet forth and deſcribed in the Evengelical Banquet,<note place="margin">Job 9. Mat. 22.</note> where he that had not the wedding Garment, was ſtruck ſpeechleſs, when the Lord ask'd him for it. Sometimes the Saints are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with this Trembling, as appears in <hi>Job.</hi> Hence it is that <hi>David</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Pſalm. 6. Pſalm 38.3.</note> 
                  <hi>O Lord rebuke me not in thy anger,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for there is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh becauſe of thine anger.</hi> Thus <hi>Hezechiah,</hi> I ſaid,
<hi>In the cutting off of my dayes,</hi> (in dimidio dierum,) <hi>I ſhall go to the gates of the grave,</hi> &amp;c. (ad portas inferi, vulg. lat.) Therefore that we ſhould not for ever be oppreſt with this Trembling, Chriſt was caſt into an Agony for us. Therefore when this Temptation ſeizeth upon us, let us pray with <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiah,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:171778:103"/> O Lord I am oppreſſed, undertake for me.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 38.14. Pſalm 17.8.</note> And with
<hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Hide me under the ſhadow of thy wings.</hi> But let us return to the bloody ſweat.</p>
               <p>We need not here ſhew any further, how it could be that he ſhould ſweat blood. Doubtleſs he was Supernatural. But let us conſider what Chriſt would ſhew unto us by this bloody ſweat.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt then, that bloody ſweat ſheweth the great perplexity that Chriſt was in, greater than which cannot be imagined. Great pain will make men ſweat. For as we never read that any, beſides Chriſt, did ſweat blood, though they were in never ſo great tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo there was never greater anguiſh than his. And no wonder: For although other men have certainly known that their death was at hand, yet none could diſtinctly foreknow the ſharpneſs of the pains of Death. But Chriſt did diſtinctly in his inner ſenſe taſte beforehand the bitterneſs of Death, as if it had been then preſent.</p>
               <p>Conſider this thou impudent ſinner, who art not afraid to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new thy ſin daily, for which thy Saviour was pleaſ'd to ſuffer this kind of puniſhment: and conſider the nature of the diſeaſe by the preciouſneſs of the Remedy. Conſider, I ſay, the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and bitterneſs of the Paſſion, how great it was, when it made him ſweat blood but to think of it.</p>
               <p>Conſider how hard it was for Chriſt to make ſatisfaction for the ſins of the heart, which we lightly paſs over without taking any notice of them. Think what condition thou hadſt been in for ever, if Chriſt had not Redeemed thee. Think upon what great anguiſh thou wouldſt have been in at the hour of death: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now while thou art in health, arm thy ſelf againſt it by the Paſſion and Prayer of Chriſt; otherwiſe thou wilt not hold out in that diſtreſs. For tis not for us to contend with death in our own ſtrength, It is too ſtrong for us. We muſt therefore flee to Chriſt, that he may ſuccour us in that ſtreight which he taſted and conquered alſo for us. The fear of Death is no other way to be vanquiſht but by Faith in Chriſt, and by long and ſtrong prayer, as Chriſt here did when he was in an Agony,

                  </gap> he extended his prayer, or he prayed more largely.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>By this bloody ſweat Chriſt would ſhew his great Love to us, which was ſo great in him, that he made all the haſte poſſible
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:171778:104"/> might be to pour out this medical blood, even before his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors came to him, that ſo he might the more ſpeedily relieve loſt man. So ready was Chriſt to ſhed his blood for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Laſtly, By this bloody ſweat he did as it were foreſhew, that his Myſtical body ſhould ſweat blood,
<hi>i. e.</hi> it ſhould be expoſed toſuch great afflictions, that if it were poſſible it ſhould ſweat blood: which we ſee fulfilled even at this day, when wicked men live in all delights and pleaſures, but godly men are caſt into a ſweat of blood. But this is their comfort, that their time of ſuffering is but ſhort, and then they ſhall enter into glory.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.45. Mat. 24.41,42.</note>
                  <hi>And when he roſe up from prayer, and was come to his Diſciples, he found them ſleeping for ſorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And he ſaith

               </p>
               <p>Chriſt returns again to his Diſciples: indeed how could he forget his own? He was more thoughtfull for them, than they were for themſelves, for he found them aſleep again. They might well be ſad who lay under ſuch failings. They that ſleep are ready to deny their life. One evil is commonly a fore-runner of many more,
<note place="margin">Spiritual ſleep, what it is.</note> and one ſin is but the beginning of another. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual ſleep is, when the ſenſes are darkened, the underſtanding ſtrangled, Faith ſtaggereth, the memory is loſt, prayer omitted, godlineſs caſt off, dangers ſleighted, and no care to avoid the Judgement to come. This is truly a moſt pernitious and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſleep: of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>
                  <hi>It is now high time to awake out of ſleep.</hi> Again,

                  <hi>Awake thou that ſleepeſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſt therefore doth now mock and deride them with a ſharp taunt or ironie, whoſe drowſineſs he had hitherto repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in vain.
<hi>Sleep on now,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and take your reſt.</hi> As if he had ſaid, yee have choſen a very fit time and place indeed to ſleep and take your reſt. Sleep ſoundly and ſweetly, eſpecially ſeeing ye are ſo ſafe and ſecure. I could not prevail with yee to watch a little with me. Go to therefore, ſatisfie your ſenſe and luſt. Sleep on. See how long yee will lye quiet. What I could not obtain at your hands, the buſineſs it ſelf, or the preſent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will force you to, &amp;c. A cutting jeer indeed; of which the Wiſdom of God ſpeaketh to thoſe that contemn him: I have
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:171778:104"/> called, but yee refuſed: <hi>I alſo will mock at your deſtruction,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 1.</note> &amp;c. But after this Ironic, Chriſt comes to ſpeak more ſeriouſly to them: <hi>It is enough,</hi> ſaith he; yee have ſlept long enough al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, yee have loytered too long. We have none but enemies about us every where, and do yee yet ſleep it out? Do yee not ſee or regard what is come upon us? Did not I ſufficiently warn yee of all this before? And now yee ſee it is fallen out juſt as I told yee. The hour is come, I muſt now ſuffer. The hands of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men are armed againſt me. The Traytor of whom I ſpake ere now is hard by. Riſe therefore, let us go meet them, leſt they ſhould ſay that we are afraid, or run away from them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we are put in mind not to think of Death as a terrible or fearfull thing. For being all baptized into the death of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> certainly by that death of Chriſt our death will be unto us but a paſſage unto life: and therefore may rather be called life than death. <hi>For he that believeth in me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt,
<note place="margin">John 11.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall not dye for ever.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of death ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded.</note> Therefore let that opinion of the Philoſophers be for ever baniſht from the ears and minds of Chriſtians, which affirmeth that death is the moſt terrible of all terrible things. But grant it, that it is true of the wicked, to whom death is truly terrible, yet to a Chriſtian there is nothing more pleaſant and deſirable than death, whereby he is freed from all evil, and inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably united to Chriſt his Lord.
<note place="margin">Phil 1. Pſalm 119.</note> Hence it is that

               <p>Thus much for thoſe things which Chriſt ſuffered in himſelf, for before he was outwardly tortured, Chriſt endured much ſorrow and pain, and that of his own accord, that ſo he might apply a full Remedy for thoſe ſins which we commit in our heart and thoughts.

                  <note place="margin">9.</note>When theſe were thus armed,
<hi>Judas Iſcariot</hi> goeth before them, not as a Captain of Souldiers, but as a Traytor of his Lord: who a little while ſince was one <hi>among</hi> the twelve, but now is one <hi>out</hi> of the twelve, or none of the twelve Apoſtles. For he had now got him more Maſters than one. In this place let us conſider both, <hi>viz. Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>Many things are to be taken notice of in <hi>Judas.</hi> But above all, his miſerable Apoſtacy, as one who of a Diſciple became a Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: of a companion of Chriſt, a Captain of Thieves. And he that even now ſupt at the ſame Table with Chriſt, who did eat of his hallowed bread with the reſt, who heard Chriſt exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to godlineſs both by word and work: but now ſlinking from that Table, he joyned himſelf with ungodly men for a little pelf, not remembring the Piety of Chriſt, and forgetfull of all hope, not regarding the Apoſtolical Dignity at all, but preferring ſo baſe and ſmall a price before all thoſe good things. For ſo doth covetouſneſs blind a man, and make him forget every thing but money.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Again, The unſearchable Counſel of God is to be obſerv'd in <hi>Judas,</hi> in that he ſuffered, or would have it ſo, that this man ſhould be tainted with Treaſon, whom before he had prefer'd to ſo honourable an Office. But take heed thou doſt not here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute unrighteouſneſs unto God. Hear what the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>For ſo much as thou art righteous thy ſelf,
<note place="margin">Wiſd. 12.15.</note> thou ordereſt all things righteouſly.</hi> Moreover,
<note place="margin">Rom. 9. Rom. 11.</note> this Example of
<hi>Judas</hi> doth partly ſet forth the wrath and Power of God; as
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Pharaoh was therefore raiſed up,</hi> that in him God might ſhew forth his Power: And partly it doth admoniſh us, not to be high mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but fear. <hi>For if God ſpared not the natural branches, take heed alſo that he ſpare not thee. Let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>
                  <hi>Judas</hi> therefore having loſt the peace of conſcience, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelf with a multitude and outward weapons, that he might not ſeem to be the ſole actor. Thus wicked men think that they ſin leſs, if they ſin with a multitude.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Beſides, he brings ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny along with him, and they men of Power too, that whereas the people durſt not condemn
<hi>them,</hi> ſo they ſhould not dare to blame <hi>him.</hi> Thus he reſolved to attempt the buſineſs by carnal reaſon, that afterward he might live ſecure. For as yet this wretched man did not feel his conſcience, it was not yet awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:171778:106"/> And whereas he could ſo eaſily obtain the aſſiſtance of both Powers, Eccleſiaſtical and Secular, againſt Chriſt: tis a ſign that both Magiſtrates were wicked, and did not rightly diſcharge their place. When <hi>Judas</hi> was thus backt on with this ayd, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, or rather precedeth and goeth formoſt againſt Chriſt. For among the Adverſaries he leads the Van and is firſt named, and not without cauſe. For as Chriſt is not betrayed but by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle and prime Diſciple, by whom he is betrayed to thoſe of whom he is the ſubſtance or Truth, they being in their Office a Type of him, <hi>viz.</hi> the Prieſts: ſo that Gods Word is ſeldom betrayed but by acquaintance and friends: Thus the <hi>Gentiles</hi> did not kill the Prophets, but the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who boaſted of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God: Thus the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> firſt of all perſecuted the Apoſtles. So alſo is it now, they that ſhould be neareſt to Chriſt are his moſt perverſe enemies and Traytors: And they that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in his Name and Office, do moſt of all oppreſs him.</p>
               <p>Furthermore let us conſider the nature and property of a wicked men in the reſt of Chriſts enemies. Firſt, They do not ſet upon Chriſt with the word of God, nor with Truth, nor Scripture, nor Righteouſneſs, nor any rational Argument, but only with ſwords and ſtaves; Club Argument, Might and Main. But if this be to overcome, who would be greater Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors than curſed and cruel Tyrants? If this be to be vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, who is a ſtouter man than a thief?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>Therefore they flock about Chriſt in a great multitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought the ſin would be the leſs, if many had a hand in it.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, They laid hold on the ſword, who were to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and be deſtroyed by the ſword in due time. They take up clubs alſo, to ſhew the rage and madneſs of their minds the more clearly. But what need was there to ſhew ſuch eagerneſs and fury againſt ſo mild and meek a Lamb?
<note place="margin">3.</note>Again, They bring forth wood againſt Chriſt, but twas dry wood, to ſhew that they were fit for nothing but to be caſt into everlaſting burnings.
<note place="margin">4.</note>Laſtly, They carry Lanthorns and Torches, by which only act they betrayed their notorious blindneſs. Firſt, in that they beg light from a Lanthorn, who might have had the Sun of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to ſhine upon them. And ſecondly, in that they were afraid of falling into the Ditches, or of ſtumbling at the ſtones in their way: but they feared not the greater danger of their
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:171778:106"/> ſoul. Thus wicked men fear where no fear is; but where the greateſt danger is, there they are ſecure. Theſe then are the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons with which ungodly men fight againſt the Saints.
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> But ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men uſe not carnal weapons, but Spiritual, <hi>viz.</hi> the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of Righteouſneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we ſee that truly fulfill'd which was ſpoken of by the
<hi>Pſalmiſt: The wicked have drawn out the ſword,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 37.14.</note> they have bent their bow,</hi> &amp;c. but by the righteous Judgement of God it comes to paſs, that their ſword hath pierced their own heart, and their bow is broken. For, for one band of Souldiers which they hired againſt the Lord, God ſent a huge hoſt of the <hi>Roman</hi> power againſt them. And becauſe they came forth with Lanthorns and Torches, and weapons of War to take Chriſt, by the juſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God the Light of the Law and Prophets fell out of their hands, wherewith their Fathers were enlightened, as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Let their eyes be darkened, that they ſee not,</hi> &amp;c.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 69.23.</note>
               </p>
               <p>See yet the wickedneſs of the Traytor. He was not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied when he had ſold Chriſt; nor was he contented, when he had conducted the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were Chriſts enemies, unto him; but he muſt yet rage with more cruelty againſt Chriſt.
<note place="margin">1.</note>For firſt, He giveth them a common token, leſt they ſhould chance to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend another in ſtead of Chriſt. For he it was whom he aimed at to deſtroy. There were many of that multitude who perhaps never ſaw Chriſt, eſpecially the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Nor doth he give them any kinds of ſign, but a token of Peace: <hi>Whomſoever,</hi> ſaith he <hi>I ſhall kiſs, &amp;c.</hi> This blind man yet thought to hide his malice, and that he could deceive his Maſter with a flattering kiſs, that he ſhould not ſuſpect him of any harm. As alſo, leſt he ſhould attempt an eſcape, or ſeek to hide himſelf, if he ſaw himſelf beſet with open danger.
<note place="margin">3.</note>And that he might prove himſelf a prodigious and notorious Traytor indeed, he doth more than he promiſed to do. For he was not content to betray Chriſt, but he exhorted and charged them to hold him faſt, and lead him away ſafely: whereby he ſputs them on, leſt they ſhould be too favourable to him; he incenſeth their rage. He uſeth all means to deſtroy Chriſt; leſt if he had eſcaped, he ſhould afterward have trounced him for his baſeneſs. This the wretch did, that he might live more ſecure when Chriſt was taken out of the way: for as yet he felt not the worm of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:171778:107"/> Whence it is evident, that he hated his Lord for the ſame cauſe as the <hi>Jews</hi> did,
<note place="margin">Wiſd. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he did diſcover and lay open the wicked thoughts of their hearts,
<hi>Wiſ.</hi> 2.14.</p>
               <p>Hence it is too plain, that <hi>Simon</hi> and <hi>Metius,</hi> or any other no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Traytors would look like very honeſt men, if they were but compared with this perfidious wretched Villain; for what was all their Treaſons to this?
<note place="margin">1.</note>Now this Treachery of <hi>Judas</hi> was figured out in <hi>Joab,</hi> who alſo betrayed, and cut off two famous men,
<note place="margin">2 Sam. 3.20.</note> 
                  <hi>Abner</hi> and
<hi>Amaſa</hi> with a kiſs.
<note place="margin">2.</note>To conclude, this Treaſon of
<hi>Judas</hi> did prefigure the crafty deviſes of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, who indeed counterfeit themſelves to be the friends of Truth, but are the Betrayers of it. For by flattery and fair ſpeeches they beguil the hearts of the ſimple.

<note place="margin">Jer. 6.</note> They ſay, (as in the Prophet,) <hi>Peace, Peace,</hi> where there is no Peace: They have Chriſt much in their mouth, but moſt of all oppoſe the faith of him, very like the Traytor <hi>Judas,</hi> who are alſo appointed to the ſame condemnation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jeſus therefore knowing all things that ſhould come upon him,
<note place="margin">John 18.4.</note> went forth, and ſaid unto them, Whom ſeek ye? They anſwered him, Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth.
<hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, I am he. And</hi> Judas <hi>alſo which betrayed him, ſtood with them. Aſſoon then as he had ſaid unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell on the ground. Then asked he them again. Whom ſeek ye? And they ſaid, Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>Jeſus anſwered, I have told ye that I am he: if therefore ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way. That the ſaying might be fulfilled which he ſpake. Of them which thou gaveſt me, have I loſt none.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All theſe things were thus done and written, that by moſt manifeſt Arguments we might ſee that Chriſt came to the Croſs willingly, and of his own accord. For if he had been compel'd to the Croſs by humane force, or fraud, the world would have appeared to be more crafty and ſtronger than he, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that Chriſt had not been God. For what kind of God is he, againſt whom the world is able to prevail?</p>
               <p>Again, He had not manifeſted ſo much love, if he had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered death unwillingly, and by conſtraint. But it is moſt plain, in that the Evangeliſts do every where ſhew that he could not be ſurprized by fraud, or humane force, till he himſelf pleaſed; I ſay it is plain, that he was both wiſer and ſtronger than the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:171778:107"/> world: and ſo his love did thereby ſhine forth more clearly. All which make much for our comfort. For as he ſaid before,
<note place="margin">John 13.1.</note> that knowing his hour was now come, that he ſhould now paſs out of this world, <hi>&amp;c. having loved his own, &amp;c.</hi> So now alſo, although he truly knew not only ſome things, but all that ſhould come upon him; yea, and knew them moſt perfectly too, and that they were hard at hand: yet did he not ſhrink, or flee, or hide himſelf, but continued his love to us unto the end. And therefore he went out to meet his enemies ſingle by himſelf againſt many, without any weapon againſt thoſe that were armed, that they might all ſee he did not fear death.</p>
               <p>At other times we often read that he made an eſcape,
<note place="margin">Joh. 8. &amp; 11.</note> and hid himſelf: but now he doth voluntarily meet his enemies. The time which his Father had prefixed was now come. In both he was our example. For by his flight, and hiding himſelf, he taught us not to tempt God: but by meeting his foes, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed us readily to reſign our ſelves to the Will of God, and to obey him with all cheerfulneſs of mind. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fled without intreaty; but at laſt he would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded when the Brethren earneſtly intreated him with many tears to make his eſcape. <hi>What mean you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to weep,
<note place="margin">Acts 9. Acts 21.13.</note> and to break my heart?</hi> here he offered himſelf to the Will of God; there he would not tempt God raſhly. Doing both in faith. For we can do neither without the help of God. We cannot avoid an imminent danger, if the hand of God reſcue us not: neither can we reſign our ſelves to the Will of God, except the Spirit of God aſſiſt us.</p>
               <p>It is alſo to be obſerved,
<note place="margin">John 6.</note> that Chriſt conveighed himſelf from them that would have made him a King; and no marvel. <hi>For he that exalteth himſelf, ſhall be brought low.</hi> Kingdoms and Empires for the moſt part are nothing but ſteep places for men to fall from, and break their necks. Contrariwiſe when they ſought to crucifie him, he came out to meet them. For he knew that the Croſs was the way to the Father. Let us alſo learn, in the hope of future happineſs, not to be affrighted at preſent and momentany evils; and not ſo much regard what we ſuffer, but conſider that by our ſufferings we are going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our Father.</p>
               <p>See how forward Chriſt was to ſuffer. For he doth not only
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:171778:108"/> meet his Adverſaries, but firſt asks them whom they ſought? He might have rebuked them ſharply, and caſt his former bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits with their ingratitude and impiety in their Teeth, yea he might have deſtroyed them all at one beck. However he doth not ſo, but with fair words he asked them what they ſought, as if he knew nothing of their deſign. This was not the time of his Judgement, but of his ſhewing Mercy. He would not be paſſionate, but patient, and overcome evil with good. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpeaks to them in a familiar manner: <hi>Whom ſeek yee?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>By which word he did warn them that they ſhould take heed what they did. Saith he, Whom ſeek ye? even an innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and him whom ye know by his Signs and Miracles which he did,
<note place="margin">Gen. 4.</note> that he is more and greater than a man. Conſider well, tis no ſmall offence to ſeek the death of the innocent. For the blood of the innocent reacheth unto Heaven: But tis much more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous to ſin againſt God. If one man ſin againſt another, the Judge ſhall judge him:
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.25.</note> but if a man ſin againſt God, who ſhall entreat for him?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>By this word (Whom ſeek ye) Chriſt jeereth their needleſs preparations, he mocketh at their fear.
<hi>Whom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>do yee ſeek? i. e.</hi> What need theſe arms? Whom do you fear? Is it me who have no Weapon about me? or do ye ſeek for my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples who alſo are unarmed men? He doth not tell them at firſt ſight, I am he whom ye look for, though he knew their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize: but firſt asketh them, that he might take occaſion from their anſwer to confute them, and that all the world might ſee and know that ſuch a huge multitude went out to take one ſingle man, as they themſelves confeſs that they did ſeek but for one.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>He firſt askt his Adverſaries whom they ſought after, before he let them lay hands on him, becauſe thereby he might yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and offer Grace unto them, <hi>q.d.</hi> To this end was I ſent, that I might hold forth unto all men, and beſtow it too upon them. And as many as have ſought me with a good heart hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, know it full well to be true. Therefore if ye alſo ſeek for Grace, lo, here I am; and ready to beſtow it on thoſe that are not worthy of it. Whom therefore do ye ſeek? Mark, O Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian: if Chriſt tendered his Grace to ſuch wicked men, how much more readily will he tender the ſame Grace, and
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:171778:108"/> himſelf to boot, to thoſe that ſeek for him in Truth?</p>
               <p>And whereas thoſe wicked and obſtinate men did not reply, we look for thee, as if they had known him: but anſwered him as if they had not known him, we ſeek Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth:</hi> it is moſt certain that they knew him not either by face, or cloathes, or voyce, although all men knew him not long ſince. This could not be by reaſon of the darkneſs, for they had Lanthorns and Torches: but it was by a Divine Power.
<note place="margin">1.</note>That firſt he might confound them, and ſo hereby at leaſt teach them that their rage againſt him was in vain.
<note place="margin">2.</note>But eſpecially it was for our conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to teach us, that although our enemies know us never ſo well by our Faces, yet they can attempt no hurt againſt us contrary to the good Will of our God. For they can neither diſcern us, much leſs deſtroy us.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Laſtly, to teach us that God can, if he will, many wayes deliver thoſe that are his.
<note place="margin">Gen 19.</note> Thus he blinded the
<hi>Sodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> heretofore, that they could not find the door of
<hi>Lots</hi> houſe all the night. And thus alſo he ſmote thoſe with ſuch blindneſs, who were ſent by the king of <hi>Syria</hi> to take
<hi>Eliſha,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. 2.</note> that although they ſaw, and talked, and walked with him, yet they knew him not, till he prayed that their eyes might be opened.</p>
               <p>Now there is no Chriſtian but doth know that our Lord at his circumciſion was called Jeſus: which Name was firſt given to him by an Angel from Heaven:
<note place="margin">Luke 2. Marth. 1</note> but he was called a
<hi>Nazarent</hi> from <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which was the countrey of
<hi>Mary</hi> his Mother, where he was brought up. Therefore theſe wicked men here call him by both Names. But the third Name, which is Chriſt, they never mention. He is called and acknowledged to be Chriſt by the Elect and Believers only, theſe own him to be the Chriſt, Meſſiah, King, and Saviour. But whereas they anſwered that they ſought Jeſus of
<hi>Nazareth,</hi> their anſwer was not much amiſs, if it had not been with an evil heart, and if they had ſo ſought him as they ought. For what is Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> but a <hi>holy Saviour?</hi> But he is not to be ſought after with weapons of war, but with pious Prayers and a ſtedfaſt Faith. Now theſe did not ſeek a Saviour, or Salvation by him, but they ſought to lay hands on him, and to ſatisfie their malice by his death and deſtruction. What doth Chriſt therefore do? He anſwereth, <hi>I am he;</hi> by which one word he ſheweth that he was willing to ſuffer: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he might have eſcaped or hid himſelf as one altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:171778:109"/> to them. But he became an Oblation, becauſe he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. It is to be Noted,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>That Chriſt freely confeſſeth his Name, and is not aſhamed of it. I am Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> ſaith he, that is, a Holy Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: whereby he doth again put them in mind, that he was ready to ſave them, if they were willing: and that they could not go unpuniſhed if they ſought his death, who was Jeſus, and a Saviour, and that a holy one too.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Inaſmuch as he had not this Name from the Humane nature, to be a holy Saviour, but by a Divine Power, which with the Godhead it ſelf met together in one perſon in him: it doth well ſuit with the proper voyce of his Divine Eſſence, when he ſaid to them that ſaid they ſought Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth, I am he.</hi> Thus he ſaid of old to <hi>Moſes, I am, that I am.</hi> He would therefore have put them in mind of this Heavenly Voyce, when he ſaid, <hi>I am he.</hi> But all was to no purpoſe, for they did nothing regard what he ſaid.
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi>
                  </note>Let us Chriſtians learn from hence to make a free confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Name and Faith. If a Tyrant ask thee, art thou a Chriſtian? Art thou a Catholike? anſwer him boldly, I am. For this word will exceedingly deject the Adverſary. But we make them worſe by our denyal and diffimulation. Hence it is, that as ſoon as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I am he;</hi> all his enemies were driven back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and made to fall on the ground. What good did the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed multitude do them now? For by one word, and that a very mild and gentle one too, that great Rabble, inraged with ſpite and hatred, and terribly armed, was beaten back, chaſed, and thrown flat on the ground without any weapon at all. Here his Power appeared very notable indeed, and that three wayes.
<note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt, in that they were beat backward, as if they had been oppoſed with ſome great force, as ſoon as they heard his voyce.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that they were made to fall, as not able to withſtand it.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, in that it threw them on their backs, as if they were compell'd to look up to Heaven and God, who had reſolutely caſt off all humane pitty and compaſſion.</p>
               <p>This fall of the <hi>Jews</hi> foreſhewed the downfall of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Whoſoever ſets himſelf againſt Chriſt, be he never ſo ſtout, ſhall fall in ſpite of his teeth. Chriſt therefore did ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully caſt down his enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>That he might render them inexcuſable, who clearly ſeeing by
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:171778:109"/> this ſign, that this Jeſus whom they ſought to kill was more than a man, and that he would turn his wrath againſt them in his own time.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>For the conſolation of the godly, that they may certainly know wicked men ſhall fall at laſt, though they triumph and Lord it for a time.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>To terrifie ungodly men, whom he could fell to the earth with one nodd if he would, did not his patience wait for their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For he that with one word was able to tumble down ſo many enemies, could as eaſily have cauſed the earth to open her mouth and have ſwallowed them up, and all their arms toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>Here we may take notice of Chriſts power in general. If he could and did thus when he was but as a Lamb, what will he do when he cometh as a Lyon? If he did this when he was to be judged, what will he do when he comes to judge? If he could do this when he was about to die, what will he do when he comes to Raign? Be wiſe now therefore, O ye Kings;

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>We ſee here the Power of the Word of God in ſpecial. For he caſt them down with a Word, and that not an auſtere or threatning one, but a very meek word. Now if theſe wicked men were not able to bear the droppings of his Words,
<note place="margin">Job 26.</note> who ſhall endure when he doth Thunder them out? Gods Word ſeems but light to ſome: but you ſee here that it is the Power of God indeed. As the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſtruck to the ground with a word: ſo neither ſin, death, nor the Devil ſhall be able to ſtand before the Word of God.
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> Whence it is that
<hi>Paul</hi> calls it <hi>the ſword of the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>Here alſo we ſee that all worldly power can do nothing againſt God. The Lord that dwelleth in Heaven ſhall have them in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion. The <hi>Jews</hi> could not take this Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> before he himſelf pleaſed, although they had brought a greater Army than ever <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Xerxes,</hi> or
<hi>Hanniball</hi> had. Thus doth God to this day often confound thoſe that truſt in their own ſtrength.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Again, Here we ſee that one and the ſame Word is conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the godly, but condemnation to the ungodly. Chriſt in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:171778:110"/> other places did often comfort his fearfull Apoſtles with this Word,
<note place="margin">Mat. 14. Luke. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>Ego ſum; It is I.</hi> Indeed the godly can hear nothing more ſweet, then when Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am he.</hi> This Word doth make all croſſes comfortable to them. But it is and will be a fearfull clap of Thunder to the wicked, when Chriſt ſhall ſay, <hi>I am he;</hi> He whom ye have pierced, whom ye have ſcorned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As <hi>Joſeph</hi> heretofore was a moſt ſharp Sword to his Brethren,
<note place="margin">Gen. 45.</note> when he ſaid, <hi>I am</hi> Joſeph <hi>whom yee ſold into</hi> Aegypt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note>Laſtly, The nature of ungodly men is here lively ſet forth.
<note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt, That by which they ſhould be made better, by it they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come worſe, this is to go backward. To go back, is to depart from God and his Righteouſneſs,
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, They fall, for they are not able to ſtand before Gods Judgement.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Again, Wicked men fall continually, till they fall into Hell.
<note place="margin">4.</note>They fall backward, for they ſee not whether they fall, nor where they lie, nor how to riſe again.
<note place="margin">5.</note>They ſee not what puniſhment they are liable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.
<note place="margin">6.</note>Laſtly, They never acknowledge their ſin, ſo as to turn from it.</p>
               <p>But the godly, though they fall, yet they fall forward, they preſently confeſs their ſin and forſake it. If they fall on the right hand, through proſperity, or on the left hand by adverſity, yet they quickly get up again: neither do they ſo fall, as to fall final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly away from God.</p>
               <p>See how true that ſaying is, <hi>Malice is often confounded, but never conquered.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 74.</note> The tumult of thoſe that riſe up againſt thee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſeth continually. Their ſuddain ruin ſhould have warned thoſe wicked men not to attempt any thing further againſt Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> for as much as they were once already confounded by him. He asked them again the ſecond time, <hi>Whom ſeek ye?</hi> that the greatneſs of their Impiety might be made manifeſt, who being ſo remarkably admoniſhed, did yet perſiſt in their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. For they anſwer as malapertly as at firſt, that they ſought Jeſus of
<hi>Nazareth:</hi> as if they would never be quiet till they had vented their hatred, though it ſhould coſt them dearer yet.
<note place="margin">Rom. 2. Eccle. 7.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Thus the wicked treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath. Who can make that ſtreight which God hath made crooked?</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though theſe ungodly men were ſenſible of Chriſts divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in them,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> yet they glorified him not as God, but reproached him the more. Juſt as moſt in the world ſtill do, they are
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:171778:110"/> convinced by the Truth of God, but nothing at all reformed.</p>
               <p>But what doth Chriſt anſwer to this ſtubborn envy of the
<hi>Jews? I have told you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I am he q.d.</hi> I have told you, and you have tried it, that I am a Prince of Power. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if ye ſtill ſeek me, and have yet no remorſe ſince ye were laid level with the earth, lo, here I am, ready to ſuffer: but ye muſt not forget that I told you, <hi>I am He.</hi> By which ſaying Chriſt ſet himſelf in our ſtead, patiently to bear whatſoever divine Juſtice ſhould exact for our ſins. Mean while he doth put forth his Power again, ſaying, <hi>If ye ſeek me, let theſe go their way;</hi> whereby he doth powerfully prohibit them to do his Diſciples any wrong, otherwiſe the Apoſtles had not ſcap'd harmleſs, if the fury of their foes had not been checkt by the power of this Precept. Chriſt by the ſame Power might have ſaid, <hi>Let me be gone:</hi> but it behooved him to ſuffer. There was nothing but this word of Chriſt, <hi>(Let theſe go their way,)</hi> that ſaved the Diſciples harmleſs in that tumult. So likewiſe doth he chuſe, and preſerve us, although we regard or mind it not.</p>
               <p>He did powerfully preſerve his Diſciples, which makes for our comfort, knowing the ſtrength of the Lords hand. He would not have them die with him: Firſt,
<note place="margin">John 15.</note> It was not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that they ſhould die at that time, becauſe, if they had died when they denyed him, they had been damned. Secondly, They were choſen to bring forth fruit, but if they had dyed now, their Calling had been cut off. Thirdly, He would not have them die with him, for this reaſon eſpecially, leſt we ſhould think that his death alone had not been ſufficient. He would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore die by himſelf alone, that he alone might he acknowledged to be our Saviour.
<hi>He trode the Wine-preſs alone,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.</note> and of the Nations there was not a man with him.</hi> Hence ſaith <hi>Moſes, The Lord alone did lead them, and there was no ſtrange God with him.
<note place="margin">Deut. 32.</note> It was he that redeemed us, and not we our ſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But above all, the Energie or force of Charity is here ſet forth unto us, which, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Is patient,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.</note> heareth all wrongs of ones Neighbour, ſeeketh not her own, and had rather endure all things it ſelf, then that its Neighbour ſhould ſuffer any thing. If you ſeek me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let theſe go their way.</hi> This is the true care that we ſhould have of our Neighbour, to be
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:171778:111"/> mindfull of him, and as much as in us lyeth to ſeek his good, even with ſome damage to our ſelves. This care
<hi>David</hi> had of his Neighbour,
<note place="margin">Sam 24.</note> when he ſaith, <hi>Theſe ſheep, what have they done? Turn thy hand I pray thee, againſt me and my Fathers houſe, for I am he that have ſinned.</hi> From this care of his Neighbours it was that <hi>Paul</hi> wiſhed himſelf accurſed for his Brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. And <hi>Moſes</hi> to be blotted out of the Book of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. Therefore let that thred-bare Proverb be for ever baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the ears and hearts of Chriſtians, which ſaith, It is a comfort to have companions in calamity. When the men of this world are in miſery, they could wiſh that all others were in the ſame condition. True charity is not grieved more, than to ſee its Neighbour in the like affliction. In the cloſe of this paſſage <hi>John</hi> ſheweth another cauſe why Chriſt would not have the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples die with him,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the ſaying which he ſpake might be fulfilled,
<note place="margin">John 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Of them which thou haſt given me, have I loſt none.</hi> This he ſaid in that Prayer which he made after Supper: <hi>Father, keep them whom thou haſt given me. When I was with them, I kept them; and none is loſt but the ſon of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.</hi> He ſpeaks there of the Apoſtles, whom the Father had added to him, as co-workers with him in preaching the Word of the Kingdom. None of theſe Apoſtles periſhed as long as Chriſt lived in the mortal fleſh, but <hi>Judas</hi> only, who was not deſtroyed by others, but by himſelf. He calleth this <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> the ſon of perdition, becauſe he died moſt miſerably, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in his own ſins. The reſt of the Diſciples were ſafe enough as long as they kept cloſe to Chriſt. Here we have a notable Example ſet down for all Preachers to obſerve and follow, <hi>viz.</hi> in that Chriſt gloried that he loſt none of thoſe whom his Father gave him. Falſe Paſtors do far other wiſe, who regard nothing leſs then their flock. Here <hi>John</hi> alledgeth this word of Chriſt, to let us ſee that that Prayer of Chriſt was very prevalent, and was heard. For if it had not been accepted, the Diſciples could not have been untouched among ſo many enemies. This then is our exceeding great conſolation, to know that Chriſt in that his Prayer was heard on our behalf, in that he feared, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Judas</hi> was nothing moved hitherto at all that Chriſt did and ſpake, but rather went on with his abominable and pernitious work. For <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that this wicked man ſtood yet with the enemies of Chriſt, yea and was hurld with them to the ground: yet was he nothing reformed. He ſtood with them not only in body, but conſent too. For tis no danger to be among evil men in body only, as appears in <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> and <hi>Daniel. Judas</hi> ſtood, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought that he ſtood, when he had ſo great a multitude of men about him, with the Eccleſiaſtical and civil Power too: but he leaned on a broken Reed. For the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> are men,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 31. Jerem. 17.</note> and not God: and their horſes fleſh, and not ſpirit. Curſed is he that truſteth in man. <hi>Judas</hi> ſtood with the <hi>Jews.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A rotten-hearted Chriſtian is no better than a
<hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> for they are both alike enemies to Chriſt. Conſider then what grief was in the ſacred breaſt of our Lord, when he ſaw himſelf betrayed by his own Diſciple, and that they ſought his death to whom he had done moſt good? It is a deeper cut to the heart, when we ſuffer by one that pretended to be our friend, than by one that we knew was our enemy.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 55.12.</note> Thus Chriſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains in the <hi>Pſalms, If mine enemy had reproached me, I could have born it. But it was the man that was of one mind with me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſay nothing that Chriſt hereby alſo foreſaw the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men towards him, that it would never ceaſe, but that with
<hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> it would perpetually continue. And ſo truly we ſee it come to paſs: indeed the outward ſufferings of Chriſt ceaſed, but mens ingratitude is not yet at an end: it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encreaſeth and waxeth more and more daily; ſo that never was it greater than now. Again,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here we may take notice of the blinding of
<hi>Judas.</hi> On the one ſide he ſaw Chriſt ſtanding with his friends, on the other hand were wicked men, ſuch as were hatefull to God and men. So that there was life and death ſet before him. But he like a Runnagate joyn'd himſelf to be worſt party. Thus that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> was fulfilled, <hi>He loved curſing,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 109.</note> and it ſhall come
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:171778:112"/> unto him: he loved not bleſſing, and it ſhall be far from him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. His ſtrange <hi>blindneſs</hi> was <hi>ſeen</hi> in that he durſt ſtand before Chriſt, and look him in the face with ſo bloody a conſcience. This is indeed the neck with an iron ſinew,
<note place="margin">Eſay 48. Jeremy 3.</note> and the brazen brow of the wicked, and truly the whoriſh forehead that will not bluſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This wretched caytiffe never thought of that bleſſed fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip which once he had with the Apoſtles: for he is not yet aſhamed to ſtout it againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, He ſtood among wicked men, and yet was not afraid. But what need I reckon up theſe things only? Hearken therefore and you ſhall hear greater things which this Villain durſt to do. It is ſaid, that he drew near unto Jeſus to kiſs him. O the wonderfull goodneſs and patience of a long ſuffering Lord! who denyed not a wicked Traytor to kiſs him, though he very well knew his malice toward him, but courteouſly received him. And O the ſtrange obſtinacy of this wicked fellow on the contrary, whom the imbraces of Chriſt, nor the kiſſes of his Heavenly Lips, did not reclaim from his malicious project: but he muſt needs ſatisfie the
<hi>Jews.</hi> Therefore with a bold face he comes near, kiſſeth, betrayeth, delivers to enemies, bids them take him, commands them ſafely to lead away the Lord Chriſt. This is the breviate of this lewd fellows wickedneſs. But ſee what cloak he hath for his knavery. If you obſerve his words and behaviour, none ſeems more courteous and friendly than he. But if you examine his heart and intention, you will find that none was a more deſperate enemy than he. His words were, <hi>Hail Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> which in Engliſh is, God ſave you, my Maſter. His beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was thus, he fell on his neck, imbraced him in his arms, and kiſſed him. Do you ſee what a notorious Hypocrite he was? He doth not ſay, O thou Samaritan; he doth not revile and curſe him, he doth not fall foul on him or ſtrike him; this had not been like a Traytor. Traytors uſe to fain friendſhip, under a fair ſhew to deceive. Good God, how full is the world now of ſuch Traytors? No man is ſecure from them. They ſneak even into our cloſets. Such the Phariſees oft ſhewed themſelves to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. Such was
<hi>Joab</hi> to <hi>Amaſa: Art thou in health, my Brother?</hi> ſaith he, (2 Sam. 20.) and with that word he ſtab'd him. Theſe are thoſe cheating Kiſſes of which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> bids us beware, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27. But
<hi>Paul</hi> teacheth us other kiſſes:
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:171778:112"/> 
                  <hi>Salute one another with an holy kiſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Such a kiſs <hi>Joſeph</hi> gave to his Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. Such kiſſes we read of in the Book of
<hi>Tobit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what doth Chriſt ſay to <hi>Judas</hi> when he came and kiſſed him? Doth he thruſt him away? Doth he ſoundly rattle him, as he well deſerved? Not ſo, but he ſpeaks him fair: he doth not call him Traytor, but Friend; that ſo he might mollifie his mind, and teach us to do the like. The meaning is: Friend, wherefore art thou come? <hi>q.d.</hi> I invite thee to be friends. For as I foreknew what thou wouldſt do, ſo now I am ready to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thee, and to receive thee into former favour and friendſhip again, though thou haſt thus ſin'd againſt me: Do not ſleight my offer, but conſider what thou art attempting, how wickedly thou dealeſt with me who have deſerved no ſuch thing at thy hands. Friend, wherefore art thou come? Who did bring thee to me, who forc'd thee hither? Was it my fault? Have any of mine offended thee? But thou art come willingly of thy own accord; The reſt are commanded and compelled, but thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and therefore thou haſt the greater ſin. O <hi>Judas,</hi> I pitty thee; how doth thy deſtruction trouble me, for whom I now ſuffer in vain? Lo, thou art the firſt on whom my blood hath no effect. Why art thou come? Surely not to my deſtruction, but thine own, becauſe thou art come to deſtroy me, by whom thou ſhouldeſt be ſaved. For how can he be ſaved that would deſtroy the very Truth, Righteouſneſs, and Salvation it ſelf? And theſe we may ſuppoſe were not ſpoken to <hi>Judas</hi> only, but to all ſuch as intend miſchief to their Neighbours. For truly he that wrongs his Neighbour, doth firſt ruin himſelf. Therefore Brethren let us look to it, and give all diligence that we be not found falſe, but reall friends of God and Chriſt. As <hi>Abraham</hi> was called the friend of God, <hi>James</hi>
2. and <hi>Lazarus</hi> the friend of Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. And Chriſt doth not call his Apoſtles ſervants, but Friends, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Judas</hi> was never the better for all Chriſts counſell. It may be he thought that Chriſt ſpake this out of fear. Therefore after he had kiſt him, Chriſt cals him yet once more the laſt time, and that with great expreſſion of love and goodneſs:
<hi>Judas,</hi> ſaith ſaith he, doſt thou betray the ſon of man with a kiſs? Now he doth lay open his ſin, and touch him to the quick; he aggravateth
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:171778:113"/> the ſin it ſelf, that ſo being terrified therewith, he might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear. O <hi>Judas,</hi> what a horrible ſin doſt thou commit? What man durſt ever do the like? Doſt thou only ſtrive to out-ſtrip all other men beſides in malice and miſchief? Beware what thou doſt. Thou thinkeſt to cheat me with thy fawning flattery, and to hide thy hatred from me. But I knew long ago what thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was, and what bargain thou droveſt with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and what thou meaneſt by this thy treacherous kiſs: thou betrayeſt the Son of Man. But conſider what an hainous crime it is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the innocent. Conſider alſo who and what he is whoſe life thou hunteſt after. Grant it, hitherto I have called my ſelf on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſon of Man: but I will make thee ſee and know who this ſon of Man is. Thou doſt not deſtroy the ſon of man only, but the Son of God too. Thou betrayeſt them both at once. Thou betrayeſt him that is thy Father by creation, thy Lord by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, thy Saviour by Redemption, thy Brother by incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thy Maſter by inſtruction, thy Friend by election, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly him that will be thy Judge by a finall Retribution. See how many ſins thou committeſt at once, and all by one kiſs. Thus thou woundeſt him by a ſhew of Love; thou ſheddeſt his blood by a ſeeming work of charity; thou ſeekeſt his death in a way of peace: what can be more odious then this horrid fact?</p>
               <p>We ſee here how unwilling God is that any man ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and how grievouſly they ſin who are the occaſion of others ruin and deſtruction: As on the other ſide, how honourably they deſerve, who are the means of others Salvation, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.20. Here Chriſt inſtructeth by his Example and Word. By this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample he teacheth us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Patiently to bear with wicked men: yea to bear the guil and treachery of falſe Friends, as Chriſt did patiently bear the falſhood of <hi>Judas;</hi> for we that are ſervants, ought not to be greater than our Lord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. So to love our Neighbour, that we wink not at their faults, as Chriſt here calleth <hi>Judas</hi> Friend, yet withall he rebuked him for his ſin.</p>
               <p>By thoſe two words which Chriſt here ſpake, be would warn every man not to be like <hi>Judas,</hi> leſt they ſuffer as he did. It were to be wiſht that there were but one Judas in the Church of Chriſt. We all indeed cry out againſt his malice: but mean while
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:171778:113"/> we do the ſame things which we blame him for. <hi>Judas</hi> was a covetous man; and for filthy lucre he ſold Chriſt. He rob'd the poor of their Alms and gifts of charity. He did not make it his buſineſs to preach Chriſt: He was not converted at the preaching of Chriſt. He took the Body of Chriſt in his ſins. He betrayed Chriſt under a colour of peace; He was an hypocrite; He was obſtinate and impenitent, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> How oft do we ſee theſe and ſuch like things in a Church? Is not he a Traytor that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth Chriſt with his mouth, but denyeth him in his works? Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo he that doth contrary to righteouſneſs, truth, charity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for money or any other temporal advantage? Likewiſe he that makes a ſhew of Love to his Neighbour, but hateth him in his heart? O curſed generation of Judas, how many and deep roots haſt thou faſtened in the earth? But the time will come, when all the followers of Judas ſhall periſh together with their Jewiſh frowardneſs. Mean while, let the godly (like Chriſt) bear and have patience with wicked men.</p>
               <p>Now when <hi>Judas</hi> had kiſſed him, no doubt but the reſt run up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Jeſus to lay hands upon, leſt the traytors ſign being obſerved, they ſhould let him eſcape. Therefore it follows in the Text;</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When they which were about him ſaw what would follow,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.49.</note> they ſaid unto him, Lord, ſhall we ſmite with the ſword?</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>And Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, Suffer ye thus far:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 22.51. John 18.11. Mat 26.52.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto</hi> Peter, <hi>Put up thy ſword into the ſheath: for all they that take the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thinkeſt thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he ſhall preſently give me more then twelve Legions of Angels? The cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?
<note place="margin">John 18.11. Mat. 26.54. Luke 22.51.</note> But how then ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it muſt be? And he touched his ear, and healed him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apoſtles underſtood not what Chriſt ſaid at ſupper when he ſpake of buying a ſword. Chriſt meant the ſword of the Spirit: but they thought that he had ſpoken of a material ſword. Therefore they preſently brought him two ſwords, and now when they ſaw their enemies, they asked whether they ſhould fight in his defence. But <hi>Peter,</hi> as one hotter then the reſt, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:171778:114"/> fluſht with the late miracle which he ſaw, when Chriſt with a word hurl'd all his enemies to the ground, and not thinking of Chriſts anſwer, draws his ſword, and falls about him, as if he would valiantly perform what he promiſed.</p>
               <p>Who would not take <hi>Peter</hi> for a very ſtout and valiant man, that durſt ſignly incounter ſuch a company of armed men? If we conſider him carnally, then he did notably diſcharge his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, that he would die with Chriſt. Did he not lay down his life for Chriſt, when he hazarded it in charging an army of men? But his Lord did not ſo conſtrue it. <hi>Peter</hi> did this more out of carnal confidence, than of ſpiritual faith. Now indeed he was bold ſo long, as he ſaw a divine Power in Chriſt; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after Chriſt hid his Power, <hi>Peters</hi> courage quickly grew cold. Whence 'tis plain, that this his valour proceeded not from faith: if it had, it would have held out in danger. For Faith is moſt couragious in difficulties. There was love and zeal in <hi>Peter,</hi> but not according to knowledge. Chriſtians are forbid to fight. <hi>Mat.</hi>
5. If we would overcome the world, it muſt be with another kind of weapon; we can do little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with a corporal ſword.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw that the ſons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> were chid for ſaying, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and conſume theſe</hi> Samaritans, <hi>as</hi> Elias <hi>did? Luke</hi> 9.54. <hi>Know ye not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>of what ſpirit ye are of? The ſon of man came not to deſtroy, but to ſave mens lives.</hi> This
<hi>Peter</hi> heard, and yet now he layes about him, as if he would kill them all, if he could. The fleſh ever loves fighting; it ſeeks to revenge it ſelf. <hi>Peter</hi> did not yet underſtand that Chriſt muſt ſuffer. Nay, he did not know that Martial Diſcipline was never taught in the ſchool of Chriſt, but that patient ſubmiſſion was alwayes learned there. Whereas <hi>Peter</hi> did that ſervant no more hurt, no thanks to
<hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> good will, but to Chriſts goodneſs, who uſeth to do good to unworthy and unthankfull men: otherwiſe fire from Heaven might more juſtly have conſumed this ſervant, or the earth have ſwallowed him up alive.</p>
               <p>But whereas <hi>Peter</hi> did in ſpecial cut off this ſervants ear, it was not by chance, but by the Providence of God: and that not without a Myſterie too.
<note place="margin">1.</note>For, Firſt, It ſignified that the
<hi>Jews</hi> ſhould from henceforth loſe the true and right hearing, or
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:171778:114"/> obedience of the Law and Prophets, and ſhould interpret all things in a wrong, and not in a right ſenſe: which alſo is come to paſs.
<note place="margin">2.</note>But ſecondly, Whereas Chriſt healed that ſervant, it ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that in due time they ſhould be inlightned again by Chriſt, <hi>when the fulneſs of the Gentiles was come in, Rom.</hi> 11.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, Whereas he whoſe ear was cut off, was the ſervant of the high Preiſt, it ſhe weth that this ſort of men, <hi>viz.</hi> the Paraſites of great perſons, have for the moſt part but one ear only, and that the left one: whence it is, that they only hear, and report to their Maſters thoſe things only which are falſe, wicked, worldly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they will neither hearken to, nor tell their Lords the truth, the Word of God, the Righteouſneſs and good ſervice of others.
<note place="margin">4.</note>But laſtly, Whoſoever is an enemy to Chriſt, hath but one ear, for he underſtandeth all things in a wrong ſenſe, and never cometh to the light of Truth. The name alſo of this ſervant is expreſt, becauſe of the miracle that was wrought on him in curing his ear again.</p>
               <p>But let us return again to <hi>Peter,</hi> who was now fallen under the power of the ſword, becauſe he had taken up the ſword. And no doubt but he had felt the force of other ſwords, if Chriſt had not protected him by his divine Power. What doth Chriſt therefore do? He reproved
<hi>Peter,</hi> and forbids him to uſe any ſuch force or violence, and that with many Arguments: for <hi>Peter</hi> by this fact was many wayes to be reproved.
<note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt, becauſe every private perſon is forbid to uſe the ſword.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe having been ſo long in the ſchool of Chriſt, he ſhould have learned that the weapons of our warfar are ſpiritual, mighty through God. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, He was an Apoſtle, yea, the chief of the Apoſtles: whoſe duty is to ſave, not to deſtroy.
<note place="margin">4.</note>Laſtly, <hi>Peter</hi> was moſt blame worthy, in that he gave the firſt blow, before any hurt was done, either to him, or to Chriſt. Therefore Chriſt doth juſtly blame him more than the reſt; He ſpeaks but one word to the reſt, <hi>Suffer ye thus far,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>q.d.</hi> It is a great work of Charity to preſerve the life of our Neighbour, and to defend him from violence: but there is another buſineſs now in hand. My Father hath appointed me to ſuffer, and to die. Let me alone therefore that I may ſuffer, and accompliſh thoſe things which the Father hath determined to do by me for the ſalvation of men.
<hi>Suffer ye yet, that I may
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:171778:115"/> be apprehended, and perfect the work of your Redemption,</hi> this he ſaid to the other Diſciples. But he ſaith more to <hi>Peter</hi> at firſt, <hi>Put up thy ſword into his place, q.d.</hi> Knoweſt thou not that I did chide thee before, and called thee Satan for this very thing? <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. Do not hinder my death, but rather ſtudy to conform to it. Throw away this thy ſword with which thou doſt kill, and ſlay men. My ſword which I gave thee, doth deſtroy, and cut down ſin, but preſerveth men. Put up therefore that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſword into the ſheath, or (as the other Evangeliſts ſay.) into its place. Now the proper place of the material ſword, is the ordinary Power. Therefore hide thy ſword here. Let that Power uſe it, not thou. If the body be ſick, the Phyſitian is to cure it, not the Plow-man. So if any thing be amiſs in the Myſtical (or rather the Politick,) body, it concerns the Power to deal with it, not every private perſon.
<note place="margin">1.</note>Chriſt then doth hereby forbid all revenge to private perſons, as it is written, <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will repay it, Deut.</hi> 32.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, He teacheth us to overcome evil with good, according to that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>Ye have heard that it hath been ſaid, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I ſay unto you, Do good to them that hate you.</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought not to defend themſelves with ſwords and ſtaves, but with Humility, Patience, Gentleneſs, Courteſies. <hi>Learn of me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for I am meek and lowly in heart, Mat.</hi> 11.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Again, Chriſt doth hereby condemn our wrath and impatience, who cannot put up, and paſs by a haſty word, nor be content to requite with the like loſs, but muſt revenge our ſelves double and trebble, contrary to that of <hi>Paul, Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good, Rom.</hi> 12.
<note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly, We are here taught, that the Goſpel is not to be fought for with worldly weapons, and humane Power, but the protection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is to be committed to God. So ſaith <hi>Paul, The weapons of our war fare are not carnal, but ſpiritual,</hi> &amp;c. Thus Chriſt never uſed any ſword, nor do we read that the Apoſtles did ever wear any. They taught the Word; the Word fought with its own force, and the Apoſtles got the victory: So ſaith Chriſt in <hi>Luke,
<note place="margin">Luke 21.</note> I will give a mouth and wiſdom, which none of your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſhall be able to reſiſt</hi>
                  <note place="margin">5.</note>Laſtly, Chriſt doth here by this word in ſpecial, forbid the Apoſtles to uſe any outward ſword.
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>They have,</hi> and ſhould have <hi>the ſword of the Spirit,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:171778:115"/> which is the Word of God.</hi> Thus
<hi>Iſaiah</hi> foretold, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles fighting ſhould be as in the day of <hi>Midian,</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">Iſa. 9.</note> as <hi>Gide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> overcame the <hi>Med anites,</hi> not with weapons, but Trumpets and daſhing of pitchers; ſo the Apoſtles ſhould ſpiritually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all the world to Chriſt by the Trumpet of Gods Word, and the patient enduring of ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the reaſons why Chriſt forbiddeth
<hi>Peter.</hi> The chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt whereof is this. He that taketh the Sword ſhall periſh with the Sword. For he that ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. So was it commanded in the Law,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 24. Chriſt plainly here intimateth, that it is not lawfull for any but the Magiſtrate to uſe the Sword. Hence we may eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how far a zeal of godlineſs may proceed. It is lawful to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the oppreſſed, to protect a juſt cauſe, but yet no farther then thy calling will bear thee out; Art thou a Magiſtrate? know that thou art the Miniſter of God to execute Vengeance on him that doth evil. But if thou art a private perſon, then admoniſh, rebuke, reprove, yet without reviling. But if thou haſt not the authority of the Magiſtrate, thou muſt not uſurp the Sword for Chriſt or a good cauſe. Chriſt and a juſt cauſe hath no need to be defended by thy private Sword. Chriſt is ſtrong enough of himſelf, and ſo is Righteouſneſs: There Chriſt addeth: <hi>Thinkeſt thou not that I could pray my Father, and he would ſend me more than twelve Legions of Angels?</hi> as if he had ſaid, if I had been to fight, and not to ſuffer, I would not have called you twelve to my aſſiſtance. I knew where to have had other gueſs help then ye, even Angels, and Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and Heavenly Powers: of which I could have gotten a huge multitude for a words ſpeaking, for they are ready at my beck and pleaſure. I tell ye, I could have at leaſt a whole Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Angels inſtead of every one of you, and that in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of an eye. And what could all the <hi>Jews</hi> have done againſt one Legion of Angels? Nay, one Angel could have ſlew them all, as he did heretofore, witneſs the great Hoſt of <hi>Senacherib:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 King. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>. Matth.
24.</note> We read alſo in <hi>Daniel</hi> (<hi>chap.</hi> 10.) of the ſtrength of Angels. With ſuch Warriers Chriſt will come to judgement. Whom if he would, he might now have had ready to ſerve him. Hereby ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Righteouſneſs, Truth, or a juſt cauſe have no need to be defended by the Sword of private men. For they have more
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:171778:116"/> then twelve Legions of Angels ſtanding on their ſide to take their part; yea they have the whole Heavenly Hoſt, and God alſo on their part: ſo that they cannot be cruſht, though for a time they ſeem to be oppreſt: Hence ſaith <hi>David, I know, O Lord, that thy Judgements are true, Pſalm</hi> 119. Again, <hi>Thou haſt loved Righteouſneſs, and hated iniquity, Pſalm</hi> 45.</p>
               <p>Chriſt afterward teacheth us in what manner we may be able to bear the wrong and violence which our enemies do to us. We ſhall never bear the leaſt in jury with a quiet mind, if we look on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the wrong that is done us, or on our Adverſaries that do it. Therefore Chriſt directeth
<hi>Peter</hi> to conſider Gods Will and Pleaſure: <hi>Wilt thou not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that I drink of the cup which my Father hath given me?</hi> He cals his Paſſion, a cup.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the Scripture is wont ſo to ſpeak, as was ſhewed before in the firſt Prayer of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſhew that death was ſweet to him, and very deſirable for the Salvation of man; as a thirſty man dieſireth beer, and drinks it with delight.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſhew that the greateſt afflictions in this world are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but as it were one draught, and preſently they are gone.</p>
               <p>Chriſt doth not only ſay, <hi>wilt not thou that I drink of the cup?</hi> but addeth this, <hi>which my Father hath given me.</hi> Nor doth he ſpeak this doubtingly; Perhaps God the Father hath given this cup, it may be God would that I ſhould ſuffer: but he ſpeaks it poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, my Father hath given me this cup. Now if it be certain that the Father hath given it, who ſhall gainſay it? We muſt not ſtruggle or oppoſe, but readily obey, when we know it to be the Will of God.</p>
               <p>He doth not ſay ſimply, God or a Judge gave it, but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; to teach us that God is a Father, even when he ſcourgeth.
<note place="margin">1.</note>Chriſt therefore here inſtructeth us, that he did not ſuffer at the pleaſure of men, but by the command of God his Father.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, He ſheweth, that he was not rebellious againſt God, but was obedient to his Father in the greateſt ſufferings, even to death.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, He teacheth us, in our adverſity not to regard men or Devils, that do what miſchief they can to us, but to look to God who ſuffers them ſo to do, as Chriſt here did. So ſaid <hi>Job, The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, &amp;c.</hi> Job
1. So
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:171778:116"/> 
                  <hi>David, Let him curſe me,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>perhaps God hath bid him curſe David,</hi> 2 Sam. 16.</p>
               <p>But there is an Emphaſis in that which Chriſt ſaith
<hi>Wilt thou not that I drink it?</hi> Wilt not thou who art but a man, a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a ſervant, yield to what God, the Creator, the Lord will have done? The Father hath fill'd this cup for me, and fill'd it to the brim: and I am not afraid to drink it off, though it bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo bitter, I will drink it to the bottom: neither thou nor any other creature ſhall hinder me. This cup is provided for me, and for none elſe, for no man but I is able to drink it, who then ſhould drink it, if I do not? If I do not drink this cup, all men will periſh with an eternal thirſt. But if I drink this cup, though it be a bitter one, yet it will queach all your thirſt. So that for this reaſon alſo he calleth his Paſſion a cup, becauſe all drink of it, not only in that we ſuffer with him, and after him, but alſo becauſe we have all our comfort from it. As therefore Chriſt reſuſed not to drink his cup, but blamed <hi>Peter</hi> for diſſwading him from it, ſo let us do alſo. We muſt not endure or hearken to him that draweth us from our obedience to the commands of God, though in his words he ſeem to extoll godlineſs. But if he be a ſubject, he is to be rebuked; if an equal, he is not to be born with; if he be a Superiour, he muſt not be feared. We ought to obey God, rather than men.</p>
               <p>Chriſt yet hath another reaſon to deter <hi>Peter</hi> from his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſty and raſh enterprize. How, ſaith he, ſhall the Scriptures be fulfilled, if thou thinkeſt to go this way to work, and chaſe away the croſs with thy ſword? Was not my Paſſion very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten foretold? eſpecially in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22. &amp; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. So the Paſſion of the Elect is propheſied of, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. How then ſhall theſe Scriptures be fulfilled, if we avoid the croſs and paſſion, and ſlip our necks out of this collar? For thus it ought to be done. So hath the Father decreed. <hi>Thus it behooved Chriſt to ſuffer, and ſo to enter into his glory,</hi> Luke 24. So ye alſo through many Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulations muſt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. Therefore put up thy ſword into the ſheath. You ſee here how effectually Chriſt inſtructeth <hi>Peter,</hi> and in him all us, to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient.</p>
               <p>In the cloſe of this paſſage <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, that Chriſt took the ſervant, healed him, and reſtored his ear again. Chriſt never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:171778:117"/> his goodneſs. In his deepeſt abaſement he would ſometimes glance out ſome beams of the Godhead. For it was the finger of God that did this and all other Miracles. And this Token, this Grace, this Favour, this courteſie he did ſhew to him that was his profeſſed enemy, that ſought his death, and who, as Chriſt well knew, would perſiſt in his malice after he had this kindneſs ſhewed to him. Here, O Chriſtian, ſee here, that what our Lord Jeſus Chriſt commanded us, he firſt did it himſelf; here I ſay, thou haſt an Example to love thine enemy. <hi>Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, &amp;c. Mat.</hi> 5. Who ever fulfill'd this command more perfectly than Chriſt? For here you ſee how that he cured their wounds who ſought his death, and did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it. Go, and do thou likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have heard how that Chriſt ran to meet his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. And how thoſe his Adverſaries were fenced with a multitude, with Power and with Arms <hi>cap-a pe.</hi> But Chriſt had very few with him, and they indeed inſtructed in War, but not with corporal Weapons: he rather diſarmed them of thoſe weapons, and went out harneſſed againſt
<hi>Judas</hi> only with love and patience, and againſt <hi>Malchus</hi> with bounty and courteſie. How unequal were their weapons? which party ſhall we cloſe with? Naturally we are inclined to that party that is moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, and beſt fortified with arms and power, let the quarrel be never ſo bad. Contrariwiſe, let the cauſe be never ſo good, we ſtick not to it, if the powers be not for it. Which hath the better on't, a juſt cauſe without arms? or an unjuſt cauſe with all accoutrements of War? Indeed wicked men for the preſent ſeem to have the upper hand. But the time will come when the Saints ſhall win the day, however they ſeem yet to have the worſt end of the ſtaff: although if men could rightly diſcern it, the Saints at preſent have the ſtrongeſt ſide. True, the ungodly wear the garland, but tis by the ſword, ruſtling, and clamour. If this be to bear away the bell, who more ſtout than cutters and high-way men? But the godly prevail both by their cauſe, and the truth of their cauſe. He is the valianteſt man that conquers by his cauſe, not by his claſhing. The <hi>Jews</hi> overcome by their ſword, but Chriſt by his cauſe. So <hi>Cain</hi> conquered by his ſword, and <hi>Abel</hi> by his ſacrifice, <hi>Gen.</hi>
4. It matters not whoſe ſword, but whoſe cauſe keeps the field. He that would get the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:171778:117"/> of his Adverſary, let him be ſure his cauſe be juſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then Jeſus ſaid unto the chief Prieſts,
<note place="margin">Luke 22.52.</note> and Captains of the Temple, and the Elders which were come to him, Be ye come out as againſt a Thief, with Swords and Staves to take me? When I was daily with you in the Temple, ye ſtretched forth no hands againſt me: But this is your hour, and the power of darkneſs.
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.56.</note> That the Scriptures might be fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See here the power of Chriſt in the midſt of his abaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though they did rave and rage never ſo much after
<hi>Judas</hi> had kiſſed him, after he had thrown them on their back, after Chriſt had confeſſed himſelf to be He whom they lookt for, yet they could not lay hands on him: that the ſaying of <hi>Iſaias</hi> might be true, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 53.7. He was offered, becauſe he was willing;
<hi>Oblatus eſt, quia ipſe voluit,</hi> ſaith the Vulg. Lat. as if it had been ſaid, whereas he was to be offered for us, it was not for want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in him to reſiſt, or from the power of them that ruſht upon him, but it was of his own accord.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve here the great <hi>blindneſs</hi> of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> who plainly <hi>ſeeing</hi> that they could do nothing but what and when he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet for all that they continued as wicked as before. Well therefore did <hi>Iſaias</hi> foretell. <hi>The heart of this people is groſs, Iſa.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="3">3. See alſo how they thirſted after Chriſts blood, in that they were not ſatisfied to ſend their ſervants, and that a great many of them, but their chief men muſt go out along with them. For the Text plainly affirms, that the chief Prieſts and Rulers of the temple, and the Elders, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſome of theſe went together with <hi>Judas,</hi> even that very night when they ſhould have eaten the Paſchal Lamb. So forgetful were they of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, that they thought of nothing but killing of Chriſt. After the literal ſenſe, they therefore went out with
<hi>Judas</hi> firſt, leſt the Traytor ſhould deceive them, for they durſt not truſt him. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, To back on the Traytor, and make him the more bold, being propt up by their preſence and Authority. Thirdly, That the ſervants might be more forward and diligent to that cruelty when their Maſters were preſent. Laſtly, Leſt if any of the common people ſhould take part with Chriſt, they might deſiſt, when they ſaw the Magiſtrates there. See how prudent the
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:171778:118"/> children of this world are to promote their deſigns. But what doth Chriſt do? He derides their Enterpriſe with moſt pithy words, <hi>Are ye come forth as againſt a thief? q.d.</hi> What famous Warriours are ye? What need had ye to make ſuch a ſtir? Where are your enemies? Where are thoſe thieves againſt whom you make ſuch War-like preparations? Were ye afraid leſt I ſhould have a great company of Believers about me? ye need not ſo much fear it. Truly, I am not your enemy, nor am I a thief or a robber. Nor have I any of the people, or arms with me, ſo that one of you had been enough to have taken me: you ſee I come to you of my own accord, and do as it were deliver my ſelf into your hands. If this were your intention, if this were your purpoſe, why did ye not take me all this while in the City, and ſave all this coſt and pains? How oft have we been toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the Temple, where ye heard me preach? Why did ye not lay hold on me then? I know ye had a mind to do it, but ye could not ſo much as hurt one hair of my head, as ye have many times tryed. But now I willingly tender my ſelf, ye may fulfill your wicked luſt upon me. But your great Array can do nothing to it. Wretched men, what could all your en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, power, wrath, fury do to me, if I were not willing? But the time is now come.</p>
               <p>This is your hour. God, even my God now gives you leave. Do therefore, not what God hath commanded, but what he now permitteth you to do. Now the power of hell reigneth. Now this power taketh place. A man cannot now turn himſelf any way, but there is moſt palpable and thick darkneſs, ſo that there is ſcarce a man at this time able to ſee or know what is holy, what is true and juſt. There is neither day, nor light, nor reaſon, nor wiſdom among men. Chriſt compared that ſatanical and helliſh darkneſs to the uſual darkneſs of the Night, when thoſe Tyrants ruſht into the Garden to take Jeſus. There was darkneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out: but their hearts were much darker. It was night, that one could not ſee another. But the hearts of thoſe wicked men were ſo blinded, that they could ſee nothing at noon day, ſo powerfully had the Devil brought his helliſh darkneſs over theſe wicked <hi>Jews.</hi> For doubtleſs, it is a moſt infallible ſign of great blindneſs and obſcurity, of darkneſs and of the night, to take and bind the true and only Meſſias.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:171778:118"/> 1. Chriſt then doth here teach us, that no harm can happen to the godly, but when and how much God pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the afflictions of the godly laſt but for an hour. That which vexeth us here is but momentany and ſhort, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He doth fully deſcribe the conqueſts of the wicked, calling them the Power of darkneſs. That is properly the Power of darkneſs when Virtue and Righteouſneſs is oppreſſed, and when lyes, injuſtice and iniquity raigneth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He doth ſecretly admoniſh his Adverſaries of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come. <hi>This,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is your hour,</hi> but your glaſs will be out ere long, you have but an hour, and then my time will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come, when all your malice will be required at your hands. By this Word therefore Chriſt gave them power to take him. Do ye ask why he did ſo? It was that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, that is, that whatſoever the true God at any time had ſpoken by the mouth of his Prophets, might indeed come to paſs. Where you ſee again, that this whole Hiſtory is grounded upon the Scripture. The reaſon of all that was done is referred to the Scripture, that we might be more firmly eſtabliſhed in the Faith.</p>
               <p>Thus far Chriſt ſpake to thoſe ſons of the Night and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who anſwered him not a word again, but being at length permitted, they poured out all their wrath and rage againſt him.
<hi>Matthew</hi> ſaith.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then came they, and laid hands on Jeſus.</hi>

                  </gap> in general. But <hi>John</hi> ſets it down more at large.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the band of Souldiers,
<note place="margin">John 18.12.</note> and the Tribune</hi> (ſo it ſhould be read) <hi>and the Officers of the</hi> Jews, <hi>took Jeſus and bound him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The inward ſuffering of Chriſt hath hitherto been premiſed. His out ward now begins.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt had permitted, rather then given them power over him, theſe ravenous Wolves worry this Lamb, curſed Thieves lay hands on the Shepheard, degenerate children on their Father, ſinners on God, the children of darkneſs on the true Light, being nothing moved with his meekneſs, or the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of his Godhead, or the amazement of his Miracles. They held him who was ready to be taken hold of, they hale him who was willing to be drag'd by them, if he would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:171778:119"/> their wicked hands could have done him no hurt.</p>
               <p>Here then was fulfilled what <hi>David</hi> in the perſon of Chriſt foretold long ago: <hi>Trouble is near, and there is none to help,</hi> Pſal. 22.11. <hi>Many bulls have compaſſed me about: ſtrong bulls of Baſhan have beſet me round. They gaped upon me with their mouthes, as a ravening and a roaring Lyon. I am poured out like water,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now although the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> recite this captivation of Chriſt plainly and in a few words (for they did it only that we might believe the ſtory to be true) yet they give us occaſion to meditate on many things, as appears chiefly out of <hi>John,</hi> who hinteth,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What was the reaſon why they could now lay hold on Chriſt, and not before, though they had often attempted it, <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe the Father had given this cup, and Chriſt himſelf obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diently took the ſame and drank it, and the hour was now come which was from Eternity determined for this to be done, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could take him. This was the reaſon, and not their force or power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The ſame <hi>John</hi> reckons up more that laid hold on Chriſt, and that by name too. The Band, and the Captain, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the <hi>Jews, &amp;c.</hi> to intimate, that this firſt furious aſſault was exceeding grievous to the Lord Chriſt. And no wonder: for how ſhould they be favourable to him on whom they had but now laid hold on, whom they had no pitty on when he hung upon the croſs, when they had vented all their rage upon him? Therefore not one nor another, but altogether fall foul on him. Beſides they were all of them incenſed againſt him with wrath and hatred, being perſwaded by their Ring-leaders that this man was a moſt miſchievous ſeducer: with this wrath and hatred they go out againſt him. Their wrath was encreaſed, in that they could not apprehend him all this while; as alſo becauſe he had thrown them flat to the ground.
<hi>Judas</hi> too had not a little ſtirr'd them up, adviſing them to keep him faſt in hold.</p>
               <p>They all fell upon him aſſoon as they had their Commiſſion, every one ſeeking to avenge his in jury, and ſtudying how to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the chief Prieſts, for whom they knew they ſhould do a moſt acceptable ſervice if they took no compaſſion on Chriſt. It ſeem'd to be juſt as if ſome ſtrong hold were ſtorm'd, ſack'd,
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:171778:119"/> plundered, none ſparing any, when a breach was once made after a long ſiege. For this cauſe <hi>John</hi> doth particularly name thoſe that took Chriſt priſoner.</p>
               <p>Note alſo that in taking Chriſt captive, there were not only the Souldiers and the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the <hi>Gentile Romans</hi> too; nor did they only that were preſent ſin againſt Chriſt, but they alſo that were abſent, the Rulers, by whoſe command it was put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. So neither one, nor other, but all men, they that have been, they that are, and they that ſhall be, of every ſex, of every ſtate, condition,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all guilty of the blood of Chriſt. He was truly taken in our ſins. Who then ſhould not be afraid? They took Jeſus, but they had been better they had let him alone. That is a good apprehenſion; when the godly apprehend him by faith, hope and charity; whereof <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>I follow after, if by any means I may comprehend,</hi> Phil. 3. So the Spouſe, <hi>I held him, and would not let him go, Cant.</hi> 8. But this is not the apprehenſion ſpoken of here, but that which the Wiſe man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of, <hi>Let us lye in wait for the Righteous, let us put him to u ſhameful death,</hi> Wiſd. 2.</p>
               <p>Thus he that took not the Angels, but the ſeed of
<hi>Abraham,</hi> is moſt unworthily laid hands on by thoſe very men whom he took by the hand. He that ſtretcht not forth his hand of mercy to the Angels, but to men when they were fallen, is now taken by their hands. O the wonderfull goodneſs of God! It was much that he ſhould ſet men ſo high at firſt: but it is much more that he ſhould abaſe himſelf ſollow for man at laſt. So it was a great thing, that commonly he did miraculouſly deliver the godly: but it is far greater, that he ſhould now in love to us yield to be a captive, that he might deliver us from Eternal ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Sin, death and the devil had taken us captive with great Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; but Chriſt willingly ſuffered himſelf to be taken, when none of theſe our catch-poles had any power over him. And becauſe he was ſtronger than they, he overcame them, and ſet us free. Therefore we may well ſing, <hi>I will extoll thee, O Lord, for thou haſt lifted me up, and haſt not made my foes to rejoyce over me,</hi> Pſalm 30.1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> addeth. <hi>And they bound him.</hi> This was the only power of darkneſs, to take to bind, whom they could not take to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand. So they did take him when his own hour was; for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:171778:120"/> one momentany hour, for afterward there was no power of darkneſs could ever any more comprehend the Light. When they had taken him, they bound him. O the horrid boldneſs of ſinners! They bound, him that they might lead him away more ſafely. For ſo <hi>Judas</hi> had forewarned them, that they ſhould look narrowly to him. And now they think themſelves ſafe, as long as they have Chriſt priſoner in their own cuſtody. But certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this taking and binding of Chriſt was their utter undoing. A figure whereof was in <hi>Sampſon,</hi> and in the Ark of God, <hi>Judg.</hi> 16. and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. For as the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> took <hi>Sampſon</hi> to their own bane, he killing many more of them at his death then in his life. And as the ſame <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> when they took the Ark of God, were many wayes ſorely afflicted by it, ſo none elſe deſtroyed the <hi>Jews</hi> but he that was taken and bound by them. The
<hi>Philiſtins</hi> rejoyced when they had taken <hi>Sampſon;</hi> ſo they did when they got the Ark of God: but their joy did not laſt long. The
<hi>Jews</hi> were glad when they had taken Chriſt, but their joy was but ſhort: for a little after the <hi>Romans</hi> deſtroyed them. Hence it is that they alſo now cry and pray, but there is none to hear or help them. And juſtly too. For he may ſay to them, that they manicled both his arms of Majeſty, and therefore he cannot now relieve them.</p>
               <p>Thus the unthankfull ſons of <hi>Adam</hi> lay hands on him, by whoſe hands they were created. They bind him who came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye all men. The meek Lamb all this while holds his peace, and openeth not his mouth; but in the bitterneſs of ſoul conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of what continuance our time is, knowing that nothing but our ſin brought him into all this trouble and ſorrow, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpake of this taking of Chriſt long ſince: <hi>Mine enemies compaſs me about, they are incloſed in their own fat,</hi> i.e. they are incorrigibly reſolved to practice their own wickedneſs, and not to be withheld by any perſwaſions, or Miracles.
<hi>Their mouth ſpeaketh proud things,</hi> Pſalm 17. We may ſuppoſe that they took him with great ſhouting, and ſcoffing, and reviling.
<hi>They have compaſſed my ſteps, they ſet their eyes bowing to the earth,</hi> that is, they have determined that neither God, nor his Juſtice, no nor Heaven it ſelf ſhall ſee or find them out. <hi>They come upon me with open mouth, as a Lyon greedy of his prey.</hi> Behold, what wrath and rage was here: which cannot be expreſt but by
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:171778:120"/> the fury of the moſt ſtout and ſavage Beaſt. So in another <hi>Pſalm: They compaſſed me about like Bees, and are extinct as the fire among the Thorns:</hi> By which words the exceſſive cruelty of Chriſts enemies is foreſhewn, <hi>Pſalm</hi>
118.12. For ſuch is the fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rage of Bees, that although they can never get honey when they have loſt their ſting, yet they will in a rage ſtick the ſame in their enemy, and rather live drones than not revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> ſpit their venom on Chriſt, never caring whether they did ever gather hony more. Therefore afterward they ſaid: <hi>His blood be on us, and on our children.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> Of which anon.</p>
               <p>Note alſo, that when the binding of Chriſt is mentioned, it is ſpoken in the plural number. It was not only one that bound him. They were the ſins of all men that did bind Chriſt. So tis ſaid in the
<hi>Pſalms, The bonds of the wicked have robbed me,</hi> Pſalm 119.61. Our firſt Parents begun to twiſt theſe cords, and we have finiſhed them. Startle here, O ſinner, when thou heareſt and ſeeſt that thy ſins did ſo cruelly intangle and bind Chriſt. But be not altogether diſmayd, for by thoſe his bonds Chriſt brake ours, and reſtored us unto true freedom. So that we may mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſing: <hi>Thou haſt looſed my bonds, I will ſacrifice to thee the ſacrifice of praiſe,</hi> Pſalm 116. Learn we hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To be thankfull for our deliverance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us take heed that we never more ſo bind Chriſt with our ſins again.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We alſo ſhould learn conſtantly to ſuffer bonds for Chriſt, if the caſe ſo require. For fetters and ſhackles are now no more a reproach, but an honour. They are ſanctified and ennobled by the ſacred Body of Chriſt; ſo that tis no ſhame, but a credit to bear them for Chriſt, as we ſee in the Apoſtles and Martyrs; who had no greater badge of honour then to ſuffer for Chriſt. And let not us bluſh to be bound for Chriſt, who firſt was in bonds for us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, Let us learn to take our ſelves captives, and to bind our ſelves with the cords of Gods Precepts, or rather with the bonds of Charity, leſt we let them take their ſwinge in thoſe things that are contrary to God. Let our eyes be held captive from ſinfull objects, our ear from idle tales, our tongue from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavoury diſcourſe, our hands from wicked works, our heart
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:171778:121"/> from evil thoughts, our underſtanding and judgement from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous and corrupt opinions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let this ſuffice in brief to be ſpoken of Chriſts ſurpriſal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they all forſook him and fled.
<note place="margin">Mar. 14.50.</note> And there followed him a certain yong man having a linen cloath caſt about his naked body, and the yong men laid hold on him. And he left the linen cloath, and fled from them naked.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here we ſee what great cruelty was exerciſed in the taking of Chriſt, at which the very pillars of Heaven ſhaked when they ſaw it. For if they had not dealt ſo barbarouſly with him, the Apoſtles would not have fled ſo ſuddenly from him. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they were very unwilling to forſake their Lord: but the exceſſive cruelty terrified and overcame them. So that Chriſt is left alone amongſt his enemies, who before was guarded with his Diſciples when the people honoured him.</p>
               <p>Now was fulfilled that which he ſpake before concerning ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Shepheard, and ſcattering the flock: Now that was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled which he ſpake elſwhere, <hi>The world ſhall rejoyce, but ye ſhall be ſorrowfull.</hi> Surely this was a very ſad and dolefull part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Apoſtles, when theſe holy men were forc'd to forſake him, for whom they had forſaken all things. No doubt but they did often look back, and make their moan to Heaven with weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes.</p>
               <p>Nor this did flight and ſcattering of the Diſciples, whom he ſo dearly loved, a little encreaſe the Paſſion of Chriſt, he having as it were born them thus long in his Boſom. <hi>Can a Mother forget her child?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. <hi>though ſhe may, yet will not I forget thee.</hi> Here then might Chriſt ſay, as <hi>David</hi> long ſince in his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon wailingly warbled: <hi>Lover and Friend haſt thou put far from me: and mine acquaintance into darkneſs,</hi> Pſalm 88.18. Again, <hi>My lovers and friends ſtand aloof from my ſore: they that ſeek my life lay ſnares,</hi> Pſalm 38. And again, <hi>Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am full of heavineſs: and I looked for ſome to take pitty, but there was none, and for comforters, but I found none,</hi> Pſalm 69. And in
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 63. <hi>I have trodden the Winepreſs alone, and of the Nations there was not a man with me.</hi> So in <hi>Job</hi> 19. <hi>Mine acquaintance are utterly eſtranged from me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Here then we ſee how true <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Paul</hi> ſpake, when they ſaid all men were lyars, but God only was true, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:171778:121"/> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. The Apoſtles promiſed with great vehemency that they would never be offended at Chriſt. But Chriſt on the contrary had told them before, that they ſhould all be offended becauſe of him. Who was now the Lyar? It is a lively picture of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: when any is caſt into bonds by the Magiſtrate, and none will own him. In a rainy day men ſit alone without company,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tempora ſi ſuerint nubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ſolus eris.</hi>
                  </note> but when the Sun ſhines we have many viſiters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By this flight of the Diſciples, we ſee what man is if God with-hold his hand. It is moſt true what Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Without me ye can do nothing, Joh.</hi> 15. Again, <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, they labour in vain that build it, Pſal.</hi> 127.1. So what Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples at Supper: <hi>Whither I go, ye cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me yet, Joh.</hi> 13.33.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let the godly hence learn to call upon God from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his heart when they are in imminent danger: <hi>Lord ſave us, we periſh.</hi> Without his help we cannot hold out. Again, if we have done any good, let us ſay: <hi>Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, bnt unto thy name give the praiſe, Pſal.</hi> 115.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Learn we alſo to take it patiently if friends forſake us in our neceſſity. What befell Chriſt may alſo happen to us. So ſaith the wiſe man: Some friend is a companion at the Table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 6.10.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let us not for the fear of man forſake Chriſt, or righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and truth; but if it chance that we ſhould flee, being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with any luſt or fear, let us not deſpair, but with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles timely return to Chriſt again by repentance. Let us return, I ſay, without delay, leſt we out-ſlip our time.</p>
               <p n="6">6. But above all, let us pray that we never be ſeparated from Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Now whereas <hi>Mark</hi> doth here annex the hiſtory of the young man on whom the enemies of Chriſt laid hold: this was done to ſhew, that there is no age or time exempted from the Croſs ſo long as the Power of Darkneſs reigneth, but all muſt ſuffer, as was plain enough to be ſeen in thoſe children of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem</hi> that were ſlain for Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. as alſo in <hi>Joſeph</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore when he was yet but young, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.</p>
               <p>But who that young man was the text doth not expreſs, nor can any eaſily determine, nor doth it much matter. Yet <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phylact</hi> is of opinion, that it was one of that houſe where Chriſt
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:171778:122"/> ſupt that night: But two things
<hi>Mark</hi> writeth of this young man, whoſoever he was.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the other young men endeavoured to lay hold of him. It had been a ſhame for the ancient men to purſue and run after children. They ſignifie therefore ſuch boyes as were ill bred, whoſe Parents were too indulgent to them, and let them do what they liſted, letting looſe their reins to all wickedneſs, and never correcting or reſtraining them from their evil and lewd courſes, as here no man checkt theſe ſawcy fellows from laying hands on this harmleſs young lad. Such were thoſe boys who mockt <hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. though they ſcaped Scot-free from man, yet God met with them with a witneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is ſaid of this young man, that he left his linnen clothes and fled away naked, chuſing rather to be ſtript ſtark naked than to be apprehended by them. Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> fled from his adultereſs Miſtris, and left his cloak behinde him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39. He that would eſcape the hands of wicked men, muſt leave the things of the world to the world, and follow Jeſus with all his heart. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ought to leave
<hi>all</hi> for the Kingdom of heaven, much more their linnen raggs. It follows in the Text:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they led him away to</hi> Annas <hi>firſt (for he was Father in law of</hi> Caiaphas) <hi>which was the High Prieſt that ſame year.
<note place="margin">Joh. 18.13.</note> Now</hi> Caiaphas <hi>was he that gave counſel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man ſhould die for the people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We have attentively heard how the Lord Chriſt was taken by wicked men, whereto alſo he willingly yeelded himſelf, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what great good would thence ariſe to all men. Thoſe night-warriours could do no more but take, binde, and lead him away. It was not their work to murther him: for ſo the Princes had reſolv'd, that he ſhould be brought to them alive. And this they did.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That none ſhould ſay he was put to death unjuſtly. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would firſt hear him, under colour of judging him juſtly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They determined to ſend his whole Anſwer to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Court. But they had no purpoſe to releaſe him, if he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered never ſo well: but were fully reſolv'd to put him to death. For dead men cannot bite. They ſtood in aw of him whilſt he lived, becauſe he reproved their hatred. The good God keep
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:171778:122"/> all Governours from following this example. They did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently put Chriſt to death at this Counſel: but brought him into the City, that they might put him to the more diſgrace and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. What tongue can expreſs what a wretched convoy this was? they dragg'd him along with great ſhoutings, in much haſt, and with many flouts, as if he had been the moſt notorious villain that ever lived, ſo faſt bound that he could ſcarſe fetch breath. And although he would have gone to ſuffer of his own accord, yet no doubt but they juſtled, and thumpt, and thruſt him from one ſide to another: for how ſhould they favour when they firſt took him, who had no pity on him when he was dying? So truly might he ſay: Is it nothing to you, O all ye that paſs by? <hi>Behold, and ſee if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, Lam.</hi> 1.12. See, I ſay, how baſely I am dragg'd, how cruelly I am buffeted, how patiently I take it. Behold a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of mad Dogs, mercileſs murtherers, and me a moſt meek Lamb in the midſt of them. See what a face their fiſts have made me, how it is beſmeared with my bloody ſweat and the <hi>Jews</hi> ſpittle, how bedew'd it is with tears, my feet galled and torn with ſtones, &amp;c. Thus he who alone was able and willing to lead us to heaven, was here led along in a moſt reproachful manner on earth. Firſt to <hi>Annas,</hi> then to
<hi>Caiaphas,</hi> for theſe were the chief of the Prieſts, and bare the ſway in the Temple and ſpiritual things, in all Eccleſiaſtical affairs. Now becauſe the matter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Chriſt was ſpiritual (for it reſpected faith and doctrine) therefore according to law they thought it belonged to that Court. Thus they deatl afterward with <hi>Paul,</hi> when they brought him before <hi>Annanias</hi> the High Prieſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 23. So they did to the other Apoſtles, when they convented them before theſe ſame men, <hi>Annas,</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas, John</hi> and <hi>Alexander, Act.</hi> 4. And for this reaſon <hi>Gallio</hi> the Deputy of
<hi>Achaia</hi> refuſed to judge <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, becauſe it did not ſeem to be civil, but ſpiritual.</p>
               <p>Theſe two men had an ill report, and were ſuſpected to have given <hi>Herod</hi> an yearly ſum of money for the Prieſtly Honour and Office, like true <hi>Simoniſts</hi> and <hi>Giezites,</hi> yea the Father of all Simon acal men. Nor would they paſs this over in ſilence, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the High Prieſt, not ſimply, as the law required, but only ſaith, that he was the High Prieſt for that year. For theſe two men did Farm the Prieſthood of the <hi>Romans</hi> at an year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:171778:123"/> rent. Whence we may gueſs that they had little godlineſs, but much arrogance and vain glory. He was firſt led to
<hi>Annas:</hi> 1. For honours ſake, out of reſpect to him; for he was the elder man, and Father in law of <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> 2. That Chriſts condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might appear more juſt, if he were ſentenced by more than one. 3. But chiefly that this wicked crew might rejoyce toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over the common enemy whom they had now taken. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> perhaps could not be preſent at the next Common-Council, by reaſon of his age, therefore would feaſt his eyes in the mean time with that deſired object. So had Chriſt foretold: <hi>The world ſhall rejoyce,</hi> that is, it ſhall triumph in my Paſſion. Thus the wicked rejoyce to do evil, and delight in the frowardneſs of the wicked, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.14. But little do they think how ſhort their joy will be. Thus they would heap honour one upon another, and ſecure their ſacriledge by common conſent, leſt if one ſhould undertake to do it alone, he might according to the <hi>Roman</hi> laws be impeached as the Author of that wicked fact. 4. Therefore was Chriſt firſt brought to <hi>Annas,</hi> that men might not hate and blame <hi>Caiaphas</hi> only, if he being the firſt that gave counſel, ſhould alſo be the firſt that condemned him. O <hi>Phariſees</hi> ye do all to be ſeen of men.</p>
               <p>But whereas Chriſt was brought before many Judges, it was not ſo much the plot of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the providence of God. For in that he was examined by many, his innocency was the more cleared. Thereby he made even all his Judges to be witneſſes of his innocency and profeſs it openly, which is the ſtrongeſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of all.</p>
               <p>And 'tis not for nothing that <hi>John</hi> doth make mention both of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and his counſel before Chriſt was brought to
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> his houſe. For this bare counſel only of
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> was the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt cauſe why not only the Rulers conſpired the death of Chriſt, but alſo why the people fell out of conceit with him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John</hi> therefore firſt nameth him, as wondering that ſo vile a man ſhould be in ſo good an Office, and ſtill continue ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He admireth that this High Prieſt did ſo greedily thirſt after the blood of Chriſt, that when others were at a ſtand, he ſhould preſently proclaim and give his verdict for his death, whereas nothing doth leſs become a Prieſt then to be a blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thirſty man.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:171778:123"/> 3. <hi>John</hi> wondered that ſo true and divine a ſentence ſhould proceed out of the mouth of ſo wicked a man. For what is more true? What is more comfortable, than that Chriſt dyed for the people? And that wicked man was the firſt that uttered this ſentence, but much againſt his intention. Therefore <hi>John</hi> ſaith, that he ſpake not this of himſelf, but by the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>John</hi> holds forth <hi>Caiaphas</hi> and his counſel to us, that we might ſee the righteous and ſtrange judgement of God concerning this man. For in him we truly ſee the Scripture ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled: that which the wicked do fear ſhall fall upon them. Again, they that fear the froſt ſhall be covered with the ſnow, <hi>Qui ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pruinam, irruet ſuper eos nix,</hi> ſo the <hi>Vulg. Lat.</hi> reads that in <hi>Job</hi> 6.16. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was afraid that Chriſt would get his place and Prieſthood from him. And becauſe he endeavoured to hold his honour by unlawful means; it was not long ere he loſt his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, himſelf too, and the whole Nation beſides. He feared a temporal loſs, and fell into an eternal and temporal both at once. This <hi>Caiaphas</hi> then is a moſt notorious preſident of all impiety, (for he is not named by way of honour, but infamy.) It was he and his Father in law on whom that word of Chriſt was princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally fulfilled: ye have made of the houſe of God a den of theeves,
<hi>Matth.</hi> 21. It were theſe two chiefly againſt whom Chriſt did more than once thunder out that eternal <hi>woe, Mat.</hi> 23. Therefore they hated Chriſt, and deſired his death more than any. For he was grievous to them to behold, becauſe he up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided them with their offending the Law,
<hi>Wiſ.</hi> 2. Wherefore <hi>Caiaphas</hi> by that his counſel endeavoured by all means to eſtrange the people from Chriſt. They did not fear God, but the people only. And they did not a little prevail therein, for by their means the people were fully ſatisfied, that if they ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſt to live he would be an occaſion of deſtruction to that place, and the Nation of the <hi>Jews;</hi> which when the carnal peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple heard, who loved their preſent temporal in joyments, and had been often in captivity formerly, they were ſtrangely incenſed with rage againſt Chriſt. For generally this is rooted in all men, that by how much the greater kindneſs one man doth to another, ſo much the more hatred doth he incur, if ever he be ſuſpected to have done it from a baſe minde, and to an ill end. So was it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:171778:124"/> 
                  <hi>Haman</hi> and <hi>Ahaſuerus:</hi> The like was it alſo with Chriſt. The people were ſtrongly perſwaded that all things which Chriſt did, tended to no other end but to bring them into bondage again. When they were thus perſwaded, it was eaſie for them to forget all Chriſts miracles and mercies, when they heard that he would be the occaſion of waſting that land which God gave to <hi>Abraham</hi> and to his Seed for a poſſeſſion, and that by his means all the people would be carryed into captivity. To hear of loſing Land and Liberty was no jeſting matter to this people. So that now they were moſt certainly aſſured that their rage againſt him was moſt righteous, yea that they could not be too woodde angry or madly incenſed againſt him. This frantick fit of fury that devout and pious High Prieſt put the ſimple people into: <hi>John</hi> therefore doth record this his counſel to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſhame and infamy.</p>
               <p>But let this ſuffice to be ſpoken of the impiety of theſe two High Prieſts. God grant never any more ſuch be born as theſe were. To proceed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> Simon Peter <hi>followed Jeſus (afar off,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 18.15.</note> Mat. 26.58.) <hi>and ſo did another Diſciple: (unto the High Prieſts Palace,</hi> Mat. 16.)
<hi>that Diſciple was known to the High Prieſt, and went in with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus into the Palace of the High Prieſt. But</hi> Peter <hi>at the door with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. Then went out that other Diſciple, which was known to the High Prieſt, and ſpake unto her that kept the door, and brought in</hi> Peter.
<note place="margin">Luk. 22.56.</note> 
                  <hi>Then ſaith the Damoſel that kept the door (earneſtly looking upon him, and ſaid) unto</hi> Peter, <hi>Art not thou alſo one of this mans Diſciples? But he denyed him, ſaying; woman, I know him not; I know not what thou ſaiſt, I am not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are ſome of opinion that there was nothing done in the houſe of <hi>Annas,</hi> either to Chriſt or <hi>Peter,</hi> but that Chriſt was preſently carryed from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and there thoſe things happened which are here ſpoken of <hi>Peter.</hi> And this they la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to prove with no contemptible arguments. Others think that the firſt buſineſs of <hi>Peter</hi> fell out in the houſe of
<hi>Annas,</hi> and that Chriſt was there queſtioned about his Doctrine and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and there ſmote on his face. Theſe ground their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on the ſtory as it is written by <hi>John.</hi> But we will not here contend about this. It may ſuffice us, that theſe things were done and ſaid, whereſoever it was it matters not much. But for
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:171778:124"/> orders-ſake, and that we may more clearly handle every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, we will imitate thoſe that follow
<hi>John,</hi> and think that the firſt buſineſs was acted in the houſe of <hi>Annas.</hi> Obſerve then that here are only two Diſciples ſaid to follow Jeſus. Chriſt went forth with all his Diſciples, however it came to paſs that before his Paſſion was hardly begun, there are but two named to be with him. The reſt were already ſcattered, every one to his own, as Chriſt had told them before, <hi>John</hi> 15. See how fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this Temptation ſhook even the Pillars of the Church. The ſons of
<hi>Zebedee,</hi> (<hi>Mat.</hi> 20.) promiſed that they could drink the cup of their Lord: but lo, they flee from it at firſt ſight, aſſoon as ever they ſaw it about to be poured out. <hi>Thomas</hi> ſaid, (<hi>John</hi>
11.) <hi>Let us alſo go, and dye with him:</hi> but here he is clean of another mind: Likewiſe all the Diſciples ſaid, (<hi>John</hi> 16.)
<hi>Now we know that thou knoweſt all things: Now we believe that thou cameſt out from God,</hi> q.d. We need not any further admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Chriſt had a little before moſt importunately exhorted them, and often inculcated it (<hi>John</hi> 15.) that they would abide in him. <hi>Abide in me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and I in you.</hi> Again, <hi>If any abide not in me, he ſhall be caſt forth as a branch, and whither,</hi> &amp;c. He had with as much earneſtneſs preſt them to love each other. But here they forget all their promiſes, and flee away from Chriſt, and ſeparate from one another. So great is the power of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>Now when they were thus fled from Chriſt, and ſeparated one from another, what could they expect but fear, and flight, and to find ſafety no where? For he that departed from God, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiteth his ſafety, falls into perpetual dread, becomes a Runna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and can never be ſecure. But two of them, although at firſt they fled for fear as all the reſt did, yet when they thought of the love of Chriſt, they were heartened and encouraged to follow him again.</p>
               <p>But, ſaith <hi>John,</hi> it was afar off. For now they were indeed ſenſible that what Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> was moſt true: <hi>Whither I go, thou canſt not follow me yet,</hi> John 13.</p>
               <p>And here we ſee plainly what effect fear and love hath in man: Fear turns him away, love turns him again till the other get the upper hand. Here fear prevailed in the Apoſtles. But afterward the love that was ſhed abroad into their hearts by the holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:171778:125"/> caſt out all fear, ſo that they could boldly ſay, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of God?</hi> Rom.
8.</p>
               <p>But who were theſe two that durſt follow Chriſt more than the reſt, although but afar off, that they might ſee what the iſſue would be? They were <hi>Simon Peter</hi> and another Diſciple. There is no queſtion to be made concerning <hi>Peter.</hi> And all men are of the mind that the other Diſciple was <hi>John.</hi> Therefore he ſaith, that he went together with Jeſus into the Palace of the High Prieſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to confirm his Goſpel, that we might know he did not write by hearſay from others report, but what he ſaw with his own eyes, being there preſent himſelf. Therefore afterward he ſaith, <hi>He that ſaw it, hath born witneſs.</hi> And that none ſhould think it was his valour that made him dare to enter the High Prieſts Palace with Jeſus when he was a priſoner; he ſaith, that he was known to the high Prieſt: As if he had ſaid, I did not go in from any courage or boldneſs, nor was it to defend or excuſe Chriſt before the high Prieſt, but only becauſe I was acquainted in his houſe. Thus he leſſeneth himſelf to avoid pride and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, that he might not ſeem to prefer himſelf before <hi>Peter</hi> in courage and conſtancy. It matters not therefore to enquire the ground of his acquaintance with the high Prieſt; It is not much to the buſineſs in hand: Nor doth any certainty thereof appear.</p>
               <p>When <hi>John</hi> was gone in, <hi>Peter</hi> ſtood without, either for fear, not daring to enter and come ſo near in ſight, or rather being but a poor man, and a ſtranger, he was ſhut out of doors. Poor men muſt not preſs into Palaces, theres no entrance for ſuch. Great mens gates are open only to the rich, and ſuch as bring preſents with them. Hence <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>They judge not the fatherleſs, neither doth the cauſe of the widow come unto them,</hi> Iſa. 1. So <hi>chap.</hi>
59. Truth is fallen in the ſtreet, and Equity cannot enter. When
<hi>Peter</hi> was ſhut out, <hi>John</hi> makes way to bring him in, but to his great loſs. It had been better for him he had never come in. His Brother
<hi>Andrew</hi> formerly gave him a much more happy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance to Chriſt,
<hi>Iohn</hi> 1. For here he is in a ſort led away from Chriſt. In
<hi>Caiaphas</hi>'s houſe there was neither Truth nor Equity to be found.</p>
               <p>But what Chriſt foretold muſt come to paſs. <hi>Thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi> Now was fulfilled that which Chriſt ſhewed him

<pb n="197" facs="tcp:171778:125"/> long ago in a kind of Figure. When the Diſciples were all in danger together upon the Sea, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14. Chriſt came to them walking on the water. When <hi>Peter</hi> heard his voyce, he offered of his own accord to go to him, and he alſo walking on the Sea to go to Chriſt, when he ſaw the wind was rough he was afraid, and when he was almoſt drowned the Lord caught him by the hand. In that Miracle was foreſhewed what here came to paſs. For here the Lord did truly walk above the waters, while his Diſciples were toyling in the Sea: becauſe when his Apoſtles were offended, he endured Tribulation quietly at his pleaſure, and ſuddenly roſe up a Conquerer of Death. So did <hi>Peter</hi> alſo walk upon the waters to go to Jeſus: for being yet mindfull of his former love he followed Chriſt, in the confidence of that lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Faith he had left, although it was afar off. But he ſaw a ſtrong guſt of wind coming againſt him, and ſo was afraid, for fear he denyed, by denying he had been drowned, if the Lord had not ſtretched out his hand to hold him. Hear now who was that wind? It is ſaid, when ſhe that kept the door ſaw him. If you conſider the maid her ſelf, ſhe was but a little cloud. But if you look to that Council of thoſe Malignants, which <hi>Peter</hi> did ſo dread, then you will find this maids word was crabbed, it was indeed a very bluſtering wind. Thus Satan that ſifter of the Apoſtles, layeth his plot ſo, as to begin his crafty Temptations with a woman, which ſex did heretofore open the door of deceit to our firſt Parent in Paradiſe,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>But tis poſſible the maid might take pitty on
<hi>Peter,</hi> and ſpeak to him to warn him, that if he were one of Jeſus his Diſciples, he ſhould make haſte and be gone out of ſight. And her words ſeem to imply as much. For ſhe did not accuſe him, nor ſpeak po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively: Nor did ſhe rail on Chriſt, calling him a Deceiver, but only a man. Finally, ſhe did but ask <hi>Peter</hi> the queſtion, whether he were not one of that mans Diſciples?</p>
               <p>What doth <hi>Peter</hi> anſwer her? Woman, ſaith he, I am not. I know him not, I do not know what thou ſayſt. See how eaſily that ſtrong Pillar was ſhaken with the blaſt of one breath. Take notice what it was that <hi>Peter</hi> denyed, and before whom. He denyed that he belonged to Chriſt. He that denies himſelf to be one of Chriſts, muſt needs give up himſelf to the Devil. <hi>Peter</hi> doth not deny before the Souldiers, or the high Prieſt, but before
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:171778:126"/> the Damoſel. What is now become of his former courage? Is it not plain enough to be ſeen now, that he took the Sword before for Chriſts Defence out of carnal affection, and not out of a ſpiritual diſcerning? If he were ſuch a ſtout Champion in a juſt quarrel, why doth he not now ſo much as with a word vindicate Chriſts innocency? I ſay not, fight for him with his Sword? If he denyed before a maid, the meaneſt of women, what would he have done before Kings and Princes? But we are all the ſame that <hi>Peter</hi> was. Before the Lord comes to Judgement, and while we are yet ignorant of our own weakneſs, we are wont to be proud of our Power, and (as it were) all on fire with zeal for God: but in the Judgement of the Lord, we are as wax before the fire, and as the duſt which the wind ſcattereth from the face of the earth, ſo we melt and moulder away, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> then is a Type of thoſe who attempt to do any thing without the Grace of God: it ſo falls out, that they both accuſe Chriſt of a lye, and what they boaſt they will do, they never perform. They charge Chriſt with a lye, for he ſaith, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing,</hi> John 15. And they are never as good as their word. For
<hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The good that I would, that do I not; but the evil that I would not, that I do,</hi> Rom. 7. Whence we may infer, that the
<hi>Evangeliſts</hi> did not ſo exactly ſet down this ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of
<hi>Peter</hi> out of any deſire to inveigh againſt, or aggravate the ſins of other men, but only for our inſtruction. And it is moſt worthy of our obſervation. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We ſee here that not the leaſt word of Chriſt was ſpoken in vain: which is a great confirmation of our Faith. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe if but one word of Chriſt had failed, we might have doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the reſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here we ſee, that there is as little as comes to nothing pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in mans power. For as iron which of it ſelf is hard, yet will eaſily be blunted with ſtones, unleſs it be hardened with liquors or ſomething elſe: ſo the mind of man, although it boaſt that it can ſcorn all perils for the love of Truth, yet will it be overcome with the ſharp brunt of oppoſition, if it be not ſtrengthened by the Grace of the Holy Spirit. If <hi>Peter,</hi> a man of ſo great Faith and Love, who lived ſo long with Chriſt, and was ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with him, that he gave him a taſte of the Heavenly Joy in his Transfiguration, did fall ſo fowly: what may be expected of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:171778:126"/> us? There is no ſecurity any where, ſo long as we are in this mortal body. An Angel fell in Heaven, <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in the world. Who then ſhould not dread the incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible height of Gods Judgements? Well therefore doth
<hi>Paul</hi> admoniſh: <hi>Be not high minded, but fear,</hi> Rom. 11. Again, <hi>Let him that ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. Thou art righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in thy own conceit, but thou canſt not tell whether thou art ſo in the ſight of God; Nay, thou knoweſt not what thou mayſt be to morrow. Look on holy <hi>Peter.</hi> Who would have believed that either he, or any man elſe ſhould have fallen from ſo great confidence and love into ſuch fickleneſs and impiety, without mighty oppoſition? On the other hand, who would have thought that that Thief ſhould have been ſaved? A man can be in no ſafer condition, than to continue with all carefulneſs in deep humility; to hope in Gods Mercy, not to boaſt himſelf in his own merits, or fooliſhly to cenſure and judge others. When thou ſeeſt any man ſin, be he never ſo bad, bewail it in thy heart, and ſay unto God, O Lord, thou art rich in Mercy, thou canſt deliver this poor wretched creature from the dunghill of ſin. So on the contrary, if thou ſee a man live godlily, glorifie God, and ſay: I beſeech thee, O Lord, preſerve thoſe gifts which thou haſt given to this man. Tis a lovely Treaſure of Grace, which thou haſt committed to him: but the Veſſel frail and brittle, and there are many Thieves lurking about it. If thou look not to it, twill quickly be all waſted and loſt. Lo, this may we learn from <hi>Peters</hi> denyal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But ſpecially it warneth all thoſe that are Rectors of Churches, not to preſume, nor to be proud. It is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous when a preſumptuous man is put into the Office of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. For he knows not how to take pitty and compaſſion upon others: He knows nothing, but how to domineer, terrifie, puniſh, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> and to hunt feeble ſouls to deſpair by his outragiouſneſs: and ſo all his Miniſtry falls to the ground. Hence it is that <hi>Paul,</hi> by way of ſpecial commendation of Chriſt, ſaith that he was ſuch an high Prieſt that was able and did know how to have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. And therefore did he ſuffer <hi>Peter</hi> to fall, that he might learn to ſhew pitty to others.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This denyal of <hi>Peter</hi> is comfort and inſtruction to all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Comfort, not to deſpair of pardon, ſee
<hi>Peter</hi> received
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:171778:127"/> again into favour after ſo great a fall. Inſtruction, to learn by his Example what courſe to take to get into favour again: Of which more at large hereafter.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It wanted not a Myſterie that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould deny his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter at his firſt entrance into the houſe of the high Prieſt, and that at the provocation of a little girl. For the firſt or chiefeſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion in Princes Courts is to deny Chriſt, that is, to
<hi>poſtpone</hi> and undervalue God and Chriſt, Equity and Verity, yea the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their own ſouls too: and only to mind and look after the things of this world. This comes to paſs eſpecially when a man is brought in by a maid, <hi>i e.</hi> by covetouſneſs. For that is the root of all evil, 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 6. But whom that faithfull ſervant, the fear of the Lord doth uſher in, he will cleave cloſe to Chriſt in the Courts of Princes, and in the midſt of his worldly buſineſs, as we ſee in <hi>David, Daniel, Heſter, Mordecay, Joſeph,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6">6. To conclude, He that reads the fall and denyal of
<hi>Peter,</hi> let him pray to the Lord that he never fall into the like Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to deny Chriſt. Let this weakneſs of <hi>Peter</hi> be our ſtrength; inaſmuch as we know of him, that after he had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the holy Spirit, he would rather ſuffer himſelf to be cut in pieces, than to deny Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The high Prieſt then asked Jeſus of his Diſciples,
<note place="margin">John 18.19.</note> and of his Doctrine. Jeſus anſwered him, I ſpake openly to the world, I ever taught in the Synagogue, and in the Temple, whither the</hi> Jews <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reſort, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing. Why askeſt thou me? ask them which heard me, what I have ſaid unto them: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, they know what I ſaid. And when he had thus ſpoken, one of the Officers which ſtood by, ſtroke Jeſus with the palm of his hand, ſaying, Anſwereſt thou the High Prieſt ſo? Ieſus anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, if I have ſpoken evil, bear witneſs of the evil: but if well, why ſmiteſt thou me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They that are of opinion that there was nothing acted in
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>'s houſe, except for honours ſake, they brought Chriſt firſt to him, theſe refer all theſe things to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> who was the High Prieſt that year. But whither it was he that did this, or whither it was <hi>Annas</hi> that was High Prieſt the laſt year, doth not much concern us: we ſhall only conſider the matter it ſelf. That High Prieſt then, whoever he was, whether <hi>Annas,</hi> or <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> he undertook to examine Chriſt by vertue of his Office, and to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:171778:127"/> convince him of his errour. Chriſt ſtands bound before him, and bears the pride of that wicked man, as if he had been the baſeſt and meaneſt of men. He yields himſelf to be examined, as if he had been the veryeſt Dunce that ever was. Is not here patience even beyond patience? Be not thou offended if proud ſilly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows deſpiſe thee. Chriſt did here lead the way by his example. Two things principally the High Prieſt enquired after:</p>
               <p n="1">1. His Diſciples. And was this ſuch a crime in Chriſt? Did that ſcurvy Prieſt know nothing elſe againſt him? And doth he therefore turn his Accuſation into Interrogatories? Perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture he would ask where his Diſciples were, why he choſe them, what he meant to do with them? This Querie tended to convince him of raiſing ſedition, and going about to bring in Innovations.</p>
               <p n="2">2. His Doctrine, what it was, and whence he had it, whether it agreed with the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets,
<hi>q.d.</hi> Thou teacheſt far otherwiſe than <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets did. Therefore thou art an Heretick and a Seducer, and thou haſt got thee Diſciples to ſpread thy Hereſie over all <hi>Iudaea.</hi> Beſides, thou haſt innovated a Baptiſm without our Authority. In ſhort, thou doſt all this, yea although thou art not of the Tribe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> yet thou uſurpeſt to thy ſelf a power of preaching. Thinkeſt thou that we will alway wink at it, and never curb ſuch inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of manners and doctrine, as we find in thee contrary to the cuſtom and Rules of the Ancients? Nay, we have born with thee too long already. Now thou ſhalt pay for alltogether.</p>
               <p>Note here, that tis not objected to Chriſt, nor could it be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt him, that he was a Murtherer, or a Thief, or an Adulterer, or an Extortioner, but only that he did teach and take Diſciples to him. This is that above any other thing which the world doth lay to his charge, that he never lets them alone, but is ſtill reproving them. <hi>The world,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hateth me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I teſtifie of it, that the works thereof are evil,</hi> John 7. If Chriſt would have held his peace, and not ſo continually have been finding fault, the world could have born him. But how can Truth be ſilent, and not declare againſt falſhood? How is it poſſible that the Sun-ſhould not ſhew what is fair, and what is foul? See our ingratitude: for even for that very thing which the world hated in him, was Chriſt moſt deſerving the greateſt

                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:171778:129"/> honour, and altogether praiſe-worthy; for his teaching the Truth, and chuſing whom he pleaſed out of the world, that they might not periſh with the world, was the higheſt favour he could ſhew.</p>
               <p>But whereas this High Prieſt queſtioned Chriſt about his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Diſciples, there was no hurt in all that. It is rather the duty of the Eccleſiaſtical Power to take care that no falſe Doctrine be broacht abroad. The Prieſt then made a fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, but his mind was quite contrary. For he knew the things which Chriſt taught were true. Beſides he might have made a true conjecture from the Signs &amp; Wonders which he wrought, that he was ſent of God, as the blind man did: <hi>If this man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>were not of God, he could do nothing,</hi> John 9. The High Prieſt ſhould not have queſtioned Chriſt for his Doctrine, but ſaid as <hi>Nicodemus, Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God,</hi> John 3. But this prophane Prieſt doth not ſo, but with a proud heart and ſtern countenance he chargeth him, that he did preach and get Diſciples to follow him. For he thought that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt would be daunted with his big words, and ſo recant and crave pardon for his fault; or if he were ſtiff in his way, that then he would defend it and himſelf, and that in his defence he might happily ſpeak ſomething to be taken hold of, the better to accuſe him. This is that which this reverend and godly Prieſt hunted ſo much after.</p>
               <p>Our moſt meek Lord replies nothing concerning his Diſciples, of whom he then knew but little good. For one had betrayed him, another denyed him, all deſerted him. But he would not lay open their faylings, teaching us not ſuddenly to diſcloſe the faults of others. Concerning his Doctrine, he anſwered, and told them where, and before whom he preacht it, but not what it was that he did teach. For he knew that the High Prieſt askt it to an ill intent. A good Judge will enquire out the Truth, not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to every baſe report: but this fellow ſought only to defame him.</p>
               <p>As to his Doctrine then, Chriſt is not ſilent, leſt he ſhould ſeem to repent what he had taught, but he ſtands to maintain it, teaching to aſſert the Truth conſtantly. The Truth of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he proved by a double Argument.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he did not preach it in hid-lock, or in a corner, but
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:171778:129"/> openly in the publick place. <hi>He that doth evil hateth the light: but he that doth the truth, cometh to the light,</hi> John 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is contented to be tryed by his hearers. <hi>I ſpake openly,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to the world, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing which I am aſhamed of, or would not have come to light.</hi> And he did plainly charge his Apoſtles: <hi>What I tell you in darkneſs, that ſpeak ye in light, Matth.</hi> 10. True, he ſpake many things to his Diſciples alone; yet for no other reaſon, but becauſe others could not bear them. Chriſt would have all that he taught ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and made known to every one, that none might excuſe their ignorance. Hence that of <hi>Paul; If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 2
<hi>Cor.</hi> 4. Chriſt indeed doth ſpeak open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the world; for now alſo doth Wiſdom cry in the ſtreets, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. ſo that none can find any ſhift for their ignorance. For it is moſt certain, that he taught in the Synagogues and Temple of the Jews, where all uſe to meet. And not only in the Temple and Synagogues, but in the Ships, and mountains, and fields too,
<hi>Luke</hi> 6. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. He preacht publickly, in the greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of men. So that they have no excuſe at all left them. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken to them, they had not had ſin, John</hi> 15.22.</p>
               <p>Thus far Chriſt ſheweth in his anſwer, where and to whom he ſpake. It remained only that he ſhould ſay ſomething of his doctrine; but that wretched Prieſt deſerved not to hear it. Chriſt therefore doth make no other anſwer here, but that he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to his auditors, and calls them to witneſs what he ſaid, a ſure ſign that he was clear in the truth of what he ſaid. Falſe Teachers will not do ſo, their own conſcience would flie in their face, and tell them, that their doctrine would not endure the light. Hereticks appeal not to their books, or to their hearers, but ſeek to maintain their errours by their ſlye and crafty wiles. They can truſt neither to their writings nor auditors. But ſaith Chriſt, Why askeſt thou me? Ask them that heard me, <hi>q.d.</hi> It is neceſſary that he ſhould be examined, whoſe fact is plain that he hath done, but how he did it doth not yet appear. So it was needfull that
<hi>Joſhua</hi> enquire of <hi>Achan</hi> what he had done. That he had ſinned was found out by lott, but wherein he ſinned was not yet known,
<hi>Joſh.</hi> 7. But I, whoſe caſe thou now ſtateſt, to refer wholly to doctrine, did uſe to ſpeak openly. I taught

Why doſt not thou ask them that heard me? or why doſt thou condemn before thou heareſt? and why doſt thou ask me, whom thou doſt not think fit to be believed? If it be an offence to teach, then all that expound the Law are tranſgreſſors. But if I have taught that which is not true, yet thou oughteſt not to judge thereof according to thine own ſuſpition and malice, nor receive information from my falſe accuſers, but from them that uſe to hear me. I do therefore appeal to my hearers, becauſe by the Law and cuſtom of Judicature, it is not allowed in a legall proceeding, that a man ſhould be his own witneſs. Ask them that heard me. They can tell what I ſaid. I am not ſo much afraid or aſhamed of my doctrine, but that I dare refer my ſelf to any that heard it. Yea I fear it ſo little, that I know what I have preach't will paſs for current among my very adverſaries. Mark it, he doth not ſay, ask my Diſciples or my friends, but he appeals in generall to his hearers, as if he had ſaid, I except none, I fear not what any of them can ſay. Here you ſee how confident the Truth is. Truth only can ſay, I fear no man. No other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſo perfect as to ſay ſo of it ſelf, beſides that which God hath revealed by his Word.</p>
               <p>Chriſt by this his anſwer did cloſely ſtrike the conſcience of that lend high Prieſt: Why askeſt thou me, ſaith he? as if he had ſaid, why doſt thou make ſuch a fair pretence, when thou doſt not ſeek after the truth, but to cavill with me? But why doſt thou ask that which thou doſt already know? I appeal to thy own conſcience. That hath anſwered for me long ſince.</p>
               <p>A terrible word indeed, when God ſhall produce our own conſcience for a witneſs againſt us. So he toucht the conſciences of the ungodly Prieſts in the caſe of the woman taken in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, when he ſaid, <hi>He that is without ſin, let him caſt a ſtone firſt at her, John</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>How truly and modeſtly did Chriſt anſwer hitherto? But what followed? What elſe, but what uſually proceeds from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainfull perſons? Inſtead of an anſwer, he had a cuff on the ear. But it is better to take a box on the ear from an open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, then a kiſs on the lips from a falſe friend. <hi>John</hi> ſaith, one of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:171778:134"/> the officers ſtruck Jeſus with the palm of his hand. Let heaven and earth here tremble and ſtand amazed at the patience of Chriſt, and the impudence of this ſervant. Who in reading this paſſage would not curſe this fellow bitterly, and wiſh that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fire might come down from above and conſume him, or that the earth might open and ſwallow him up alive? But Chriſt would hereby teach us patience. In like manner did they at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time more then once endeavour to ſtone him for telling the truth, <hi>John</hi> 8. Theſe ſervants of the Prieſts confeſt long ſince that never man ſpake like Chriſt, <hi>John</hi>
7.46. yet now they buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet him on the face. Thus the ſtout ſtriker and the fawning flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer bragged that he was the ſtrongeſt of all the Champions, of whom the Spirit of the Lord ſpeaketh in the Prophet: <hi>They lie in wait for my ſoul, the mighty are gathered againſt me, Pſalm</hi> 59. Who are thoſe mighty ones, but they that thus ruſht upon the ſtrength of God? The choyceſt and chief among them was he that fell ſo cruelly fowl upon the wiſdom and power of God, and all to pleaſe his good maſter, and ſhew him how ready and diligent he was to ſerve him in that buſineſs. Here we ſee what the Judge, and what the Judgement was. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That cannot be righteous Judgement, where every one domineereth over the accuſed before Judgement is paſſed upon him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Judge was unjuſt, in that he ſaw the accuſed party abuſed before ſentence was pronounced againſt him, and yet he held his peace and reproved them not; much more in that he ſaw the guiltleſs wronged before his face.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the iniquity of this ſervant argued the unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Maſter. For as the Ruler and Judge of the people is, ſo are his officers, <hi>Eceleſ.</hi> 10. <hi>If a Ruler hearken to lies, all his ſervants are wicked, Prov.</hi> 29.12. Such a Judge, ſuch a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; ſuch accuſers had Chriſt, who would not forbear till the Judge had given ſentence. No marvail then if Chriſt be caſt and condemned at the bar of mans tribunall. So was it with <hi>Paul</hi> when he rendered an account of himſelf in the Court, the high Prieſt commanded him to be ſmote in the face, contrary to Law and right. Chriſtians when they confeſs the truth, muſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally expect nothing elſe from the world, but to be ſmitten on the face. Thus Chriſt who judgeth all men juſtly, yea who
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:171778:135"/> doth mercifully forgive the wicked upon their repentance, could find no juſtice when he was judged, much leſs mercy.</p>
               <p>See likewiſe the impiety of this ſervant, who would ſpitefully miſuſe the innocent, to inſinuate into the favour of an ungodly Magiſtrate; and to get the favour of man, would forfeit the friendſhip of God. Conſider whom he ſmote and ſo hardly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, even the Lord of Majeſty: Him, I ſay, whoſe authority over the creature is ſuch, and to whom the obedience of the creatures is ſo loyall, that they had all rather be turned into no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, then by their naturall actions tranſgreſs but the leaſt or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of their Creator. This is he whom this vile ſlave did baſely ſtrike, who if he were not ſaved by him whom he thus abuſed, would perpetually be annihilated. And if the Lord himſelf whom he ſmote had not with-held them, every creature would have riſen up againſt this ungodly wretch, to have aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the injury of their Maker. For if the creatures have many times inflicted vengeance upon thoſe who offended the ſervants of God: (as the earth ſwallowed up <hi>Dathan</hi> and
<hi>Abiram,</hi> the water overwhelmed <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> the fire burnt up the
<hi>Sodomites,</hi> &amp;c.) much more would the creatures have exerciſed venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance over this vile vaſſall, who behaved himſelf ſo malapertly towards the Lord of Majeſty himſelf, had not this Lord forbad them. Conſider this thou ungratefull heart, who canſt not bear ſo much as a rugged word, but preſently it ſets thee all on fire, that thou ſcorcheſt thy ſelf with the fire of hell: thou doſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile, bann, murmure, and canſt not ſtay till God avenge thy wrong, but inſtantly plotteſt thy revenge by word and deed. Thou art ſorry if thou canſt not requite an injury, but thou boaſteſt of thy revenge. But here thou ſeeſt the King of all, who took ſuch an injury from ſo unworthy a fellow, and that in a publick place, and upon his moſt holy face, which the Angels ſo much deſire and love to behold. The arm of the Lord could have ſmote the ſmiter again; and not only him, but that whited wall alſo, I mean that wicked high Prieſt, whom ſo churliſh a clown bolſtered up: But he received the wrong, put up the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front, held faſt his patience, returned inſtruction. All for our example.</p>
               <p>Note that this ſervant did aggravate that notorious injury
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:171778:135"/> which he did to Chriſt with moſt reproachfull language. <hi>Doſt thou anſwer the high Prieſt ſo?</hi> As if he had ſaid, Doſt not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what a baſe fellow thou art, and what a gorgeous high Prieſt my Maſter is? This ſervant is a figure of all flatterers; as alſo of all ſuch who abuſe and ſmite Chriſt in his poor members, in Princes Palaces; I mean ſuch as againſt Law and Equity, grind the poor to gratifie their Lords. Beſides, they do and threaten many things to the oppreſſion of the poor, for which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had any Warrant or Commiſſion from their Maſter at all. But what doth the high Prieſt ſay to all this, when he ſaw his own ſervant ſo ſawcily behaving himſelf, before he had paſt his ſentence againſt him? He is ſilent, lets him alone and go on, takes no notice of it, makes as if he had not ſeen it, and yet if any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy had ſtruck but his dog, he ſhould quickly have heard of it with a witneſs. It is the nature of Tyrants to eſteem more baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the poor then of their dogs. Thus Chriſt, both then and now too, hath none to avenge his wrong in the world. Our own injuries we quickly revenge, but as for God, let him be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed never ſo much, we regard it not. But mind a little, with what face will that ſervant behold Chriſt at the day of Judgement, whom he ſmote ſo outragiouſly? how pale will he look with fear then? But it was not this ſlave only that ſtruck Chriſt, we all ſmote Chriſt in him. For if it had not been for our ſins, this fellow could not ſo much as have toucht Chriſt. Our ſins ſtrengthened his hand, and ſtretched it out to ſtrike Chriſt. Therefore how ſhall we appear before that Judge, whom we have ſo abuſed and diſgraced? We ſee here how great our ſins are, and how juſtly we may tremble to think of the ſufferings of Chriſt. But let us not therefore deſpair, but rather ſeek com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of that very ſame Chriſt, who endured all theſe things: For, he did not only ſuffer from us, but for us too. He took this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon him, to deliver us from eternall ſhame. But what doth Chriſt here do? He doth not ſtrike again, but patiently puts up the wrong. He was more ready to turn the other cheek, then to return like for like, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. And although he held his hand, yet he did not hold his tongue, but reproves him that ſmote him, or rather courteouſly admoniſhed him. <hi>If I have ſpoken evil,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>bear witneſs of the evil.</hi> Chriſt might have ſaid; How elſe ſhould I anſwer thou baſe paraſite? What
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:171778:136"/> ſhould I ſay or do more? Wouldſt thou have me fall down and kiſs the toe of thy grand Idol, this high Prieſt, and call him the light of the world? I anſwered to what he askt me, what wouldſt have more, thou naughty man? Thus I ſay, and more ſharply might Chriſt have rounded up this viſe varlet. But, for our pattern, he anſwers him very mildly, and that with a forked argument, which might have pinnioned and bound this fellow hand and foot. Chriſts meaning is thus: either I have ſpoken well or ill: this thou thy ſelf muſt confeſs. If evil, thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to ſhew wherein. But if well, thou ſhouldeſt not beat me contrary to Law and Equity. Chriſt ſaid not this out of anger or paſſion. Nor did this contradict what he ſaid at another time, of turning the other cheek, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. For if you rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that word, you will find that Chriſt did fully and perfectly follow his own doctrine. For that great command of patience is to be obſerved, not ſo much in the bodily oſtentation, as in a hearty preparation and readineſs to ſuffer, and is thus to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: If any man injure, reproach, or wrong thee, thou ſhouldſt be ſo far from rendring evil for evil, or to revenge thy ſelf, that thou ſhouldſt ſooner and more readily ſuffer more wrong, and paſs by greater injuries. This is to turn the other cheek to the ſmiter. In this ſenſe is Chriſts word to be taken: Did he revenge himſelf? In no wiſe. Did he revile again? No, by no means. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>When he was reviled, he reviled not again,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. Thou heareſt his defence, but not his recrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; thou heareſt his advice, but not his reproach. If I have ſpoken well, why ſmiteſt thou me? I will not ſtrike thee again, I will not avenge my ſelf on thee, but I warn thee that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, leſt worſe things befall thee from God. Thou beateſt me on whom thou waſt not able to lay thy band. Thou beateſt me now, whom thou didſt admire before, <hi>John</hi> 7. Thou beateſt me, who art no Judge: Thou beateſt and miſuſeſt me, who never wronged thee in all my life. Thou getteſt nothing by this thy miſuſage of me, but thy own condemnation. Chriſt then did here ſhew his gentleneſs three waies: Firſt, in that he avengeth not himſelf when he might eaſily have done it. Secondly, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angry. Thirdly, in that he did admoniſh, inſtruct, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay good for evil to him.</p>
               <p>Here then in the firſt place our raſhneſs is reproved, who are
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:171778:136"/> ever greedy of revenge, even for the ſmalleſt wrongs done to us; Forgetting what is written, <hi>The wayes of them that remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber injuries, tend to death,</hi> Eccl. 10. Again, <hi>Forgive thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the hurt that he hath done unto thee, ſo ſhall thy ſins alſo be forgiven when thou prayeſt,</hi> Eccl. 28.2. Firſt then let us learn to bear wrongs patiently, inaſmuch as we are not the firſt, nor they only who have been ſufferers. Secondly, learn we to be ſilent in ſufferings, leſt we murmur againſt God.</p>
               <p>And whereas Chriſt took all things patiently beſides this blow, there is reaſon for it. Firſt, he held not his peace now, becauſe that ſervant ſhould not think that the Truth was to be ſmother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by outward perſecution. Secondly, that he might think that it was lawfull for him, and ſuch as he was to do what they liſt to the poor. Thirdly, That he might not think, that Princes were not to be reproved by the Word of God; whereas the Word of God ſpares none: for it is judge of all alike. By this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he would teach us to bear our croſs patiently: yet ſo as that we conceal not what may tend to the ſalvation of our perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. As alſo that we ſhould never approve of an unjuſt cauſe, though we ſuffer in bearing witneſs againſt it: but to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, and rebuke them that offer violence: and be alwayes ready nevertheleſs to bear what our enemies ſhall inflict on us.</p>
               <p>What hath hitherto been ſpoken concerning that blow, and Chriſts anſwer, was plainly foretold by <hi>Iſaiah: I hid not my face,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>from ſhame and ſpitting,</hi> Iſa. 50. Again,
<hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair.</hi> Again, <hi>I have ſet my face like a flint, and I know that I ſhall not be aſhamed, &amp;c.</hi> So <hi>Micah,</hi> chap. 5.1. <hi>They ſhall ſmite the Judge of</hi> Iſrael <hi>with a Rod upon the cheek.</hi>

                  <hi>Now</hi> Annas <hi>had ſent him bound unto</hi> Caiaphas
<hi>the high Prieſt,
<note place="margin">John 18.24. Mat. 26.57. John 18.18.</note> where the Scribes and the Elders were aſſembled. And the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Officers ſtood there, who had made a fire of coals (for it was cold) and they warmed themſelves: and</hi> Peter <hi>ſtood with them, and warmed himſelf. And another maid ſaw him,
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.71.</note> and ſaid unto them that were there, This fellow was alſo with Jeſus of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth. <hi>They ſaid therefore unto him,
<note place="margin">John 18.25.</note> Art not thou alſo one of his Diſciples? And another ſaid,</hi> (Luke. 22.58.) <hi>thou art alſo of them. And again, he denyed with an oath,</hi> (Mat. 26.72.) <hi>ſaying,</hi>
                  <pb n="210" facs="tcp:171778:137"/> (Luke 22.58.) <hi>Man, I am not. I do not know the man.</hi> (Mat. ibid.) <hi>And after a little while</hi> (Luke 22 58.)
<hi>about the ſpace of an hour after</hi> (Luke 22.59.) <hi>came unto him they that ſtood by, ſaying, Surely thou alſo art one of them, for thou art a</hi> Galilean, (Mar. 14 70.)
<note place="margin">John 18.26.</note> 
                  <hi>and thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee. One of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the High Prieſts (being his kinſman, whoſe ear</hi> Peter <hi>cut off) ſaith, did I not ſee thee in the garden with him? Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan he to curſe and to ſwear,</hi> (Matth.
26.74) <hi>ſaying, I know not this man of whom ye ſpeak:</hi> (Mar. 14.71.)
<hi>And immediatly while he yet ſpake the Cock crew,</hi> (Luke 22 60.)
<hi>And the Lord turned, and looked upon</hi> Peter. <hi>And</hi> Peter
<hi>remembred the word of the Lord Jeſus, how he had ſaid unto him, Before the Cock crow twice thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi> (Mar. 14.30.) <hi>And he went out and wept bitterly,</hi> (Mat. 26.75.)</p>
               <p>Chriſt is led bound to <hi>Annas,</hi> from him he is carried priſoner to <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> Among that ſort of people the Trurb is ever in bonds. For none dare ſay any thing to them, but what they like and love to hear.</p>
               <p>The wickedneſs of <hi>Annas</hi> is ſeen, in that he did not releaſe Chriſt after he had made a ſufficient and full anſwer, but ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to be manicled: yea and bound him over to a greater and more potent Adverſary. <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith expreſly (<hi>chap.</hi> 14.53.) that in the houſe of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> the chief Prieſts; and the Elders, and the Scribes were aſſembled, earneſtly expecting eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moment when Chriſt ſhould be brought priſoner before them. This was the ground of their meeting, that very Night when they ſhould have thought of eating the Paſchal Lamb, in remembrance of their deliverance from the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> bondage. But this they wholly neglected, ſo burning hot were they againſt Chriſt, that their malice would not let them think upon any thing, but how they might ſooneſt diſpatch Chriſt out of the way. Theſe were their godly exerciſes which they employed their time in all that Sacred Night of the Poſsover. Here note, that they who ſhould have been a ſuccour to the afflicted, and a refuge to the oppreſſed, and whom it did beſt become to be juſt Judges, becauſe of the Prieſthood, Office, Knowledge and Gravity which they had: Chriſt found theſe as bad, nay worſe than any; it being moſt truly ſaid of them: <hi>Wickedneſs came from the antient Judges, who ſeemed to govern the people,</hi> Hiſt. of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:171778:137"/> 
                  <hi>Suſan ver.</hi> 5. The Seed of
<hi>Canaan</hi> indeed, not of <hi>Juda.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs pity is to be expected from any, than from Hypocrites. Chriſt is never more undervalued, than by thoſe to whom he ſhould be moſt welcome.</p>
               <p>Thus when his Adverſaries were met and ſtaid for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt was brought in before them bound, and beaten, and wofully handled: with great noyſe and hooting they drag him along, being over-joy'd that they had got ſo great an enemy in hold. The meek Lamb ſtands in the midſt of ravenous Wolves, looking lowly on the ground, and ſpeaking not a word: but they on the contrary gazing upon him with bended brows and a ſtern countenance, gnaſhing on him with their teeth, as if they would inſtantly devour him, which they had done, but that they intended to reſerve him for greater torments. But before the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſet down what was concluded in this Council, they firſt diſpatch the buſineſs of
<hi>Peter,</hi> which began in the houſe of <hi>Annas,</hi> (as ſome think, although others are of another mind) and was finiſhed in the houſe of
<hi>Caiaphas.</hi> And firſt they ſet down the cauſe and occaſion of this his denyal: <hi>The ſervants,</hi> tis ſaid, <hi>ſtood by the fire, and</hi> Peter <hi>with them.</hi> For now his love began to wax chill. 'Tis a cold Seaſon indeed when Chriſt is denyed. The Servants were here talking among themſelves, of what was now in agitation, and another maid came by chance, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving <hi>Peter</hi> ſomewhat melancholly, ſuſpecting how it was, ſaid to them that ſtood by: And this man alſo was with Jeſus of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth.</hi> When they heard this, they took more notice of him, and divers of them preſt upon him, and laid it cloſe to him. This Tryal and Temptation was greater and more grievous than the former. For now he was not queſtioned by a weak Woman, but by men, and that many too, and they all armed, yea and Servants of the High Prieſts. But he came off juſt as he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He denyed him again. And no wonder. For he that could not withſtand the firſt on-ſet, how ſhould he ſtand out the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>econd aſſault? He that was daunted by a woman, how ſhould he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his courage againſt armed men? Finally, how could he chuſe but fall again, who deſerted his own party, and was converſant with wicked men, ſtanding idle and warming himſelf by the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, as if he had quite forgot himſelf; whereas Chriſt ſaid, I did not chuſe ye to ſtand idling it out, but that you ſhould go, and bring forth much fruit.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:171778:138"/> 1. See here the effect of ill company.
<hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed Chriſt when he was among the Diſciples, but when he was with the High Prieſts Servants, he denyed himſelf to be a Chriſtian. So true is that ſaying, <hi>With the holy thou wilt be holy; and with the froward thou wilt learn frowardneſs,</hi> Pſalm 18. Thus the
<hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, they were mingled with the Heathen, and learned their works,</hi> Pſalm 106. Therefore the godly are called upon, <hi>Come out of</hi> Babylon <hi>my people,</hi> Rev. 18.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve what a rare thing it is to find the profeſſion of Chriſt in Kings Courts: indeed generally they are debauched in Princes Courts, who before were godly and holy men.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Note alſo that the Devil is wont, of all men, to tempt thoſe eſpecially that are idle. Be alway doing ſomething, that the Devil may never find thee idle; <hi>For idleneſs teacheth much evil,</hi> Eccl. 33.27. Slothfull Paſtors are compared to <hi>Peter</hi> ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus idle, who being greedy of filthy lucre ſit down and ſerve the ſinfull humours of men, but the Sword of Gods Word they put up into the ſcabberd, not thinking what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>A little that a righteous man hath, is better then great riches of the wicked,</hi> Pſalm 37.16. They fancy themſelves ſtout Porters of Heaven, if they can but take bribes liberally, and ſpeak the Truth ſparingly. Theſe are ſuch as <hi>Peter</hi> was when he ſtood by the fire, rather then what he was in the day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, and afterward when he ſaid, <hi>Silver and gold I have none,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Act.</hi> 3. But as <hi>Peter</hi> was more ſorely tempted this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time then he was at firſt: ſo he ſinned and ſell more hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly. For now he doth not barely deny his Maſter, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwears him too. Thus one ſin not repented of ſinks a man into another greater than the former. We ſee it in <hi>David,</hi> when he had committed Adultery, and repented not, ſuddenly he fell into murther, which was a greater ſin, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11. By <hi>Peters</hi> fall let us learn,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To reſiſt ſin in the beginning, and to daſh theſe brats of <hi>Babylon,</hi> that is, the firſt motions of ſin, againſt the Rock Chriſt. He that yields at firſt, is eaſily drawn into many ſins.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If we chance to ſlip, let us not lye in ſin, but quickly get out of it: As in <hi>Peter</hi> one temptation continually followed another, till <hi>Peter</hi> fell to the bottom: ſo the Devil never leaves hurrying thoſe whom he hath once laid hold on, till he hath caſt
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:171778:138" rendition="simple:additions"/> them into the depths of ſin. So it befell <hi>Peter.</hi> He had twice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed Chriſt. The Cock had crow'd once, as <hi>Mark</hi> relateth, yet he doth not confeſs or acknowledge his ſin, nor ſo much as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake his bad company. And what came on't? A freſh Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſeth, the Servants aſſault him again, and put him to it more cloſely. One affirmed that he was a <hi>Galilean,</hi> Another ſaid that he ſaw him with Jeſus in the Garden. Here <hi>Peter</hi> was in great danger by his kinſman, whoſe ear he had cut off. What ſhift doth
<hi>Peter</hi> now make, ſeeing himſelf beſet round? he flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly denyes again: yea he began (as tis ſaid) to curſe and to ban himſelf moſt bitterly, and to wiſh all the miſchief that might befall him, if ever he did ſo much as know the man. When fear hath got the upper hand in our heart, we can do nothing but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt. What then ſhall we ſay or think of this ſo great a lapſe of the chief of the Apoſtles? Lo he hath not a word to anſwer, but this, <hi>I am not, I do not know him, I cannot tell what you ſay,</hi> when neither the men nor the women did threaten him, nor would they have done him any hurt at all and although the men convinced him plainly to his face (for he heard them ſay, <hi>Surely thou art one of them,</hi> Thou art a
<hi>Galilean,</hi> thy ſpeech bewrayeth thee, We ſaw thee in the Garden) yet he had the face to deny all, yea and to imprecate moſt direfull things on himſelf, whereas if they had but held a naked Sword at his breaſt, he would ſcarce have ſtood it out. But thus the word of Chriſt muſt be fulfilled, not that he was forced to it, but that Chriſt knew beforehand that he would deny him.</p>
               <p>Let us take heed that we do not flatter our ſelves, or excuſe and mince our faults by <hi>Peters</hi> fall, or any of the Saints failings. Theſe things are not written to that end, but to make us more wary and watchfull before we fall, and to keep us from deſpair after we have fallen. But why do we ſpend ſo much time about <hi>Peters</hi> ſin? Lets come at laſt to his Repentance. This will do us ſome good. After
<hi>Peter</hi> had fallen deep enough, and was about to ſink deeper, yet Chriſt caught him by the hand, that he ſhould not be quite drowned; While he was yet ſpeaking, behold the Cock crew: Chriſt alſo turned about and looked on <hi>Peter:</hi> A gracious Look indeed. The good and gracious God vouchſafe to look upon every ſinner with theſe Eyes of Mercy, and then of Delinquents they would ſoon become Penitents. The maid
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:171778:139"/> that kept the door caſt her eyes on
<hi>Peter,</hi> but this miſerable man was never the better for that. But this of Chriſt was another gueſs look then that, and had a far other effect. This Look of Chriſt was nothing but the hearing of his Voyce as it were inwardly ſpeaking: How now <hi>Peter?</hi> Why doſt ſin againſt thy conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Come back again to me, put thy truſt in me. O the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Grace and Mercy of Chriſt, who did ſo kindly convert <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to himſelf whom he had ſo often denyed!</p>
               <p>Obſerve here, that <hi>Peter</hi> came again to himſelf, and was brought to Repentance two wayes: The Cock crowing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the preaching of the Law: but Chriſts looking on him ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the preaching of the Goſpel, or the powerfull and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inſpiration of Chriſt in the heart of a ſinner, by which the ſinner is ſtirred up to an hatred of ſin, and a deſire of Grace.</p>
               <p>If theſe two be not wrought in us, we ſhall never repent or ceaſe from ſin. See a Pattern of true Repentance in <hi>Peter.</hi> When he was warned by the Cocks crowing and Chriſts Look, firſt he remembred the words which Chriſt told him before. Then he goeth immediately out of
<hi>Caiaphas</hi>'s houſe, and being got out, he wept bitterly. When he knew his ſin, that he had denyed Chriſt, how could he chuſe but weep bitterly? In this weeping condition he continued till the Reſurrection of Chriſt: nor can any man imagine what ſorrow and grief, yea what horrour of conſcience tormented him all that while. He could ſee nothing but hell it ſelf, till Chriſt appeared again to him in the Reſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. So is it with every one elſe that cometh to the knowledge of ſin by the Law. Wherefore bleſſed art thou, O holy <hi>Peter!</hi> and that many wayes. Firſt, in that Chriſt lookt ſo favourably on thee: Secondly, becauſe thou didſt remember the words of Chriſt: Thirdly, becauſe thou didſt leave thy bad company: Laſtly, becauſe thou didſt bitterly bewail thy ſin. Theſe four things are requiſite to make up true Repentance. Firſt, the Grace of God to move and work upon the heart: Secondly, to conſider the terrifying Word of God in the Law, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting Word in the Goſpel: Thirdly, a ceſſation from ſin: Laſtly, Weeping and godly ſorrow for what is paſt. By theſe means a ſinner may yet recover the favour of God again.</p>
               <p>They that comfort themſelves with <hi>Peters</hi> fall, let them here obſerve and remember, that he repented after he had fallen,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:171778:139"/> not many years after, but preſently. Go thou and do likewiſe, Repent and live.</p>
               <p>To conclude, concerning <hi>Peter,</hi> obſerve that there are three things required to perfect our love of God, <hi>viz.</hi> that we love him affectionately, prudently, and fervently.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When <hi>Peter</hi> formerly ſaid, <hi>Be it far from thee Lord, this ſhall not be unto thee, that thou ſhouldſt die,</hi> Mat.
16. There he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Chriſt affectionately, but not prudently. For it was expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that Chriſt ſhould die, but <hi>Peter</hi> was not willing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When he followed Chriſt after he was taken priſoner, he loved him affectionately and prudently, (for it is true prudence, not only not to hinder the ſuffering of Chriſt, but alſo to imitate it) but he did not yet love him fervently and couragiouſly: therefore he denyed him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But when he received the Spirit he loved him valiantly and boldly. And therefore Chriſt after his Reſurrection asked him the third time, <hi>Simon ſon of</hi> Jonas, <hi>loveſt thou me?</hi> John 21. For this reaſon alſo are we commanded not ſimply, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God:</hi> Tis added moreover, <hi>With all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy ſtrength:</hi> which is all one as if it had been ſaid, Love ſweetly, prudently, boldly, manful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. It follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the chief Prieſts and the Elders,
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.59.</note> and all the Council ſought falſe witneſs againſt Jeſus,
<note place="margin">Mar. 14 56.</note> to put him to death but found none: yea though many falſe witneſſes came. But their witneſs agreed not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. At the laſt came two falſe witneſſes, and bare falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt him, ſaying, We heard him ſay, I am able to deſtroy (I will deſtroy) this Temple of God that is made with hands, and within three dayes I will build another made without hands.</hi> But neither ſo did their witneſs agree together.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have heard what the wicked Officers did to Chriſt. Now we are come to the chiefeſt of them, even the Princes themſelves, who kept the Fort and ſtrong Hold of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of whom no evil could be ſuſpected, much leſs expected. But whats the iſſue? Theſe High Prieſts, theſe Phariſees, theſe Elders are the worſt in all the pack. So <hi>Jeremy</hi> found them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore. When he had a while reproved the ſins of the common people, at laſt he bethought himſelf: Surely theſe are poor, they are fooliſh: for they know not the way of the Lord, nor the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:171778:140"/> Judgement of their God. I will get me unto the great men, and will ſpeak unto them; For they have known the way of the Lord, and the Judgement of their God: but theſe have altogether broken the yoke, &amp; burſt the bonds, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. This was here verified in them to a tittle. Therefore not long after that alſo was fulfilled in them which
<hi>Jeremy</hi> ſpeaks further, <hi>Wherefore a Lyon out of the Forreſt ſhall ſlay them, and a Wolf of the evening ſhall ſpoyl them.</hi> But what do they? <hi>Annas</hi> had examined Chriſt of his Doctrine, but becauſe he anſwered not to his mind as he expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, yea he ſo anſwered that they could find no Law againſt hiw: for he proved his Doctrine to be irrefragable, and his life ſpotleſs and moſt innocent. Wherefore now they take a new courſe, and go another way to work with him, that every one ſhould bring in altogether what they could or had to ſay againſt him, that ſo from every bodies charge they might patch up a juſt accuſation againſt him. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> his Counſel was enough to ſtir up the people, but it was not ſufficient to regulate the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Pagan Judge. Yet <hi>Caiaphas</hi> would not have it ſpoken of him, that he oppreſſed the innocent, and therefore had tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically put Chriſt to death. Wherefore he laid his plot ſo, that becauſe they could find no juſt cauſe, yet at leaſt they ſhould ſeek out ſome fair pretence to deſtroy Chriſt. For he knew that the firſt thing that would be enquired into about the death of the man, would be for what cauſe he ſuffered, and what his crime was that made him deſerve to die: and if no juſt reaſon were given for it, the power would be accuſed of Tyranny. This <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> knew well enough: therefore he doth firſt hunt after a ſufficient ground to kill Chriſt. The next way to obtain this is by Evidences. Teſtimonies prove the crime, and the crime makes lyable to death. Thus innocent <hi>Naboth</hi> was hated by King <hi>Ahab</hi> to the very death, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21. but that he might rid him out of the way, there muſt be good ground for that, and to bring this about, there were falſe witneſſes ſuborned, and ſo ſentence of death was pronounced againſt the innocent. The ſame did ſome ungodly men attempt againſt <hi>Daniel,</hi> whom truth it ſelf miraculouſly delivered from his falſe witneſſes, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. So Saint <hi>Steven</hi> was ſtoned to death by falſe witneſſes,
<hi>Act.</hi> 7. The like proceedings were there in the judging of Chriſt. See what righteous Judgement, and what a holy Council was here! Chriſt
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:171778:140"/> was now in hold, bound, buffered, and many wayes abuſed by the ſervants, and yet no man knows why or wherefore he was accuſed. Wicked men uſe to condemn before they know the crime. Thus
<hi>Saul</hi> cut off the Prieſts of the Lord before he heard them, or before they were convinced by any, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22. So <hi>Jehoiakim</hi> ſlew
<hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rijah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Jer.</hi> 26. Ungodly men ſay as they did,
<hi>Jer.</hi> 18. <hi>Come, let us ſmite him with the tongue, and let us regard none of his ſayings.</hi> Thus Satan hurryeth the hearts of wicked men with a ſpirit of giddineſs. But theſe men exceed and do more. For they labour all they can to find out falſe witneſs againſt Chriſt, knowing they could find no true evidence. And all this they do in the night of the Paſsover, when they ſhould have eaten the Lamb. Mean while they accuſe Chriſt as a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſour of the Law, whereas but of late he had eaten his Lamb with great devotion. But thoſe wicked men did moſt notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly neglect the Law, and greedily thirſt after innocent blood. In this Council there was nothing but wrath, envy, hatred and violence raigned. All the cry was, kill, ſlay, deſtroy crucifie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is that Council of which the holy Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> of old ſpake, ſaying, Simeon
<hi>and</hi> Levi <hi>are Inſtruments of cruelty; O my ſoul, enter thou not into their ſecret, curſed be their anger, for it was fierce</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Gen.</hi> 49. In this Council was fulfilled that which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in the perſon of Chriſt foretold long ſince in many of his <hi>Pſalms: They gaped upon me as a ramping and roaring Lyon,</hi> Pſalm 22. Again,
<hi>They that ſeek my hurt ſpeak miſchievous things, and imagine deceits all the day long,</hi> Pſalm 38. Again, <hi>They have ſharpened their tongues like a Serpent, Adders poyſon is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their lips,</hi> Pſalm 140.
<hi>Their throat is an open ſepulchre,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm 5. <hi>Falſe witneſs did riſe up, they laid to my charge things that I knew not,</hi> Pſalm 35. <hi>They opened their mouth wide againſt me, and ſaid, Aha, Aha, our eye hath ſeen it,</hi> ver. 21. <hi>This thou haſt ſeen, keep not ſilence, O Lord, be not far from me. Falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are riſen up againſt me, and ſuch as breath out cruelty,</hi> Pſal. 27. See how many things <hi>David</hi> propheſied of this Council. Their rage was nothing humane, but altogether helliſh and devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; for they did not rave to ſatisfie their rage, but rather to kindle and inflame themſelves more yet. Therefore they let no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſlip that may encreaſe their fury.</p>
               <p>But what good did they get by forging falſe witneſs againſt
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:171778:141"/> Chriſt? For however many falſe witneſſes came, yet no full proof could be made of any charge: For what one witneſſed for a truth, the next varied from him: ſo their witneſs did not agree, juſt as it was in the ſtory of <hi>Suſana.</hi> And no wonder: for when Teſtimonies are falſe in themſelves, they can never agree together. Here then the great and unblemiſhable inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of Chriſt was cleared and fully proved to all men, as one whom ſo many falſe witneſſes were not able to accuſe falſly; and ſo many enemies that took their oaths againſt him, could not find ſo much as the ſhadow of any cauſe againſt him. Firſt then let Chriſtians here learn ſo to live, that their enemies may not be able to ſpeak ill of them. Secondly, but let Biſhops and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters be here taught by this Example, that they behave themſelves blameleſly.</p>
               <p>Finally, That Chriſts innocency may yet ſhine more brightly, two falſe witneſſes ariſe: (this was their proper name by which they wree called, inaſmuch as they did not rightly relate the words or meaning of Chriſt.) Theſe ſtand up, and are confidently perſwaded that they ſhall bring in juſt ground enough to make away with Chriſt. O deſperate knaves, how durſt ye lye ſo againſt the very Truth, yea againſt God himſelf, to curry favour with a wicked man? Is this your keeping the Law, which command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that none ſhould bear falſe witneſs againſt his Neighbour? Go to, ſpeak on, we will hear what ye have to ſay. <hi>We,</hi> ſay they, <hi>did hear him ſay, that he could deſtroy the Temple of God,</hi> &amp;c. Here they tell a lye at firſt, they ſpeak falſe, not only as baſe fellows, but as per jur'd Rogues. Our Lord Chriſt never ſpake thoſe your words; how then could you hear them from him? But thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he did ſay, <hi>Deſtroy this Temple, and in three dayes I will raiſe it up.</hi> And that we may know of what Temple he ſpake,
<hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>He ſpake this of the Temple of his Body,</hi> John
2. The <hi>Jews</hi> Temple was built with hands: but Chriſts Temple, that is, his Body, was built without the workmanſhip of man.</p>
               <p>How do theſe words of Chriſt agree with the Teſtimony of theſe Villains? Chriſt ſpeaks of his Body, which not he, but the
<hi>Jews</hi> would deſtroy, he would only raiſe up the ſame again. But theſe witneſſes ſpeak of the Temple of ſtone, which was built in the dayes of <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Zorobabel,</hi> which Temple alſo Chriſt highly honoured, as <hi>Haggai</hi> propheſied, <hi>chap.</hi> 2. The diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:171778:141"/> and deſtruction of this Temple belonged to <hi>Titus</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour and the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why do ye not hale him before your Tribunals, and produce your witneſſes againſt him, who did indeed deſtroy your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Could ye find no claw at Chriſt, but your Temple? Thus did ye afterward to Saint
<hi>Stephen,</hi> Act. 6. But whats become of your Temple now? We can tell where our Chriſt is, whom you accuſed of ſacriledge in reference to your Temple: and in due time ye ſhall know it too with a witneſs. In the mean time we are ready through his Grace, when he ſhall ſee it fit, to offer our bodies, which are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.</note> to you or any other unbelievers to be afflicted by you for his Names-ſake: being well aſſured that they ſhall be raiſed again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to us in the general Reſurrection, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>But what ſaith the <hi>Evangeliſt? Their witneſs,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>did not agree,</hi> and twas true indeed, they did not. For the
<hi>Jews</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves underſtood that Chriſt ſpake of the Temple of his Body. Therefore they ſaid to <hi>Pilate; We remember that this deceiver ſaid, after three dayes I will riſe again,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. And they are not aſhamed to caſt this in Chriſts teeth, when he hung upon the Croſs, <hi>Thou that deſtroyeſt the Temple of God, come down,</hi> &amp;c. What would not ſuch men have done? We have daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them, from whom we take wrong quietly and ſilently, not counting them worthy our reply, as here Chriſt did, and as was propheſied of him, <hi>I was dumb with ſilence, I held my peace from good, while the wicked was before me,</hi> Pſalm 39. Where <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> calls it a holding his peace from good, not alwayes to excuſe his innocency, but to commit it to God the Judge of all. What then doth <hi>Caiaphas</hi> do here, when he ſaw his project diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the witneſſes flag in all their Evidence, and Chriſt ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſilent all the while? He ſtands up in the midſt of all, as if he would do ſome great matter, and daunt Chriſt out of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance with his perſon. And now all men were gazing upon him.
<note place="margin">Iſa. 16.</note> See the pride of this falſe <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> but true <hi>Moabite;</hi> of this mungril Prieſt, but a very Thief and Robber. He is very exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proud: but his pride is more then his proweſſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Mar. 14.60.</note>
                  <hi>And the High Prieſt ſtood up in the midſt, and asked Jeſus, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Anſwereſt thou nothing? What is it which theſe witneſs againſt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:171778:142"/> thee? But he held his peace, and anſwered nothing. Again, the High Prieſt asked him, and ſaid unto him; art thou the Chriſt, the ſon of the bleſſed?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 26.63.</note>
                  <hi>I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us, whether thou be the Chriſt the ſon of God? Jeſus ſaith unto him, Thou haſt ſaid,</hi> (<hi>I am,</hi> Mar. 14.62.)
<hi>Nevertheleſs, I ſay unto you, Hereafter ſhall ye ſee the Son of man ſitting on the right hand of Power, and coming in the clouds of Heaven: Then the High Prieſt rent his cloaths, ſaying, He hath ſpoken blaſphemy, what further need have we of witneſſes? Behold, now ye have heard his blaſphemy, What think ye? And they all condemned him to be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of death,</hi> Mar. 14.64.</p>
               <p>When the witneſſes could not promote the deſign, the High Prieſt himſelf ſtarts up, and ſhews the madneſs of his mind by the motion of his body. His hairbrain'd and unbridled rage would not ſuffer him to be at reſt when he could find no cavil againſt him. <hi>Anſwereſt thou nothing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to thoſe things which theſe witneſs againſt thee?</hi> And he did well to anſwer nothing: for what ſhould a guiltleſs perſon anſwer to moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious lies? They gave in falſe Teſtimony from the true ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, to which alſo they did add and diminiſh as beſt ſerv'd their turn, and made moſt againſt Chriſt. Therefore Chriſt held his peace, becauſe ſuch a Judge, ſuch Witneſſes: ſuch Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, ſuch Officers. There was a ſhew of Judicature and Legal proceedings, but in deed and in truth twas nothing but a rabble of moſt cruel Thieves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Then Chriſt doth hereby ſhew his Righteouſneſs, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were unworthy to hear his anſwer, and alſo becauſe thoſe things which they brought againſt him were utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, and needed not an anſwer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By his ſilence, he alſo ſheweth his mercy, to wit, leſt they ſhould ſin more, if after they heard him give ſatisfaction, they ſhould yet perſiſt in their envy.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whereas <hi>Eve</hi> offended by her tatling, he would make ſatisfaction by his ſilence to ſo many falſe aſperſions caſt upon him.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By this his ſilence he ſhewed alſo his Wiſdom. For as he was God, he knew that whatever he had anſwered would have been wreſted to an ill ſenſe, and ſo they would not have been the better by his anſwer; but rather the more incenſed againſt him.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="221" facs="tcp:171778:142"/> 5. But above all, he did hereby ſhew his patience, of which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſied of old: <hi>As a Lamb before the ſhearer is dumb, ſo opened he not his mouth,</hi> Iſa. 53. All this was for our Example, that we ſhould learn to ſleight the tongues of clamorous and calumniating men, and rather force our ſilence, than make our defence to no purpoſe. We ought to anſwer them that ask a reaſon of our Faith. But when open wickedneſs goes about to exſtinguiſh and put out the Truth, then we are to be ſilent, and not caſt the precious Myſteries of God before hogs and dogs, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>But by this ſilence of Chriſt the rage of <hi>Caiaphas</hi> was more incenſed then appeaſed: for he thought it was done in contempt to him. Thus foaming therefore in this fury, when neither the multitude of witneſſes, nor his own authority could get any an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: he no doubt, but by Satans inſtigation, deviſeth another courſe, to wit, a fearfull exorciſm or adjuration, by which only he hoped to wreſt an anſwer from him: but if he ſhould ſtill hold his peace when he was conjured to ſpeak, he might then proclaim and condemn for a manifeſt deſpiſer of Gods Name. This was the cauſe and reaſon of this exorciſm and conjuration. Therefore he ſcraped all his poyſonous rancour together, and ſhot all the force of his fury in one Dart, ſaying, <hi>I adjure thee by the living God that thou tell us whether thou art the Chriſt, the Son of the bleſſed God?</hi> It was the cuſtom and manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> to ſwear by the living God. This cuſtom of ſwearing they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Law, <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.
<hi>Joſh.</hi> 2. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> urged Chriſt to anſwer by the higheſt Oath, the Devil his Maſter had ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him, who himſelf alſo formerly ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>What have I to do with thee, Jeſus thou Son of the moſt High God? I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure thee by God that thou torment me not,</hi> Mar. 5.7.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is much to be obſerved, that this
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> doth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and acknowledge theſe two, to wit, Chriſt or the Meſſias, and the Son of God to be both but one, which coming from the mouth of a Jewiſh High Prieſt, is an evident Teſtimony for us againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> For although he might doubt whether that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus that ſtood then before him, were the Chriſt, and Son of God: yet by his own queſtion he plainly confeſſeth theſe two, the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, and the Son of God, might well conſiſt and agree in one perſon: ſo that the ſame that was the Meſſias might alſo be the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:171778:143"/> Son of God, which Paradox our
<hi>Jews</hi> ſtrongly deny, and oppoſe it thus: If, ſay they, your Jeſus were a Chriſt, or a Meſſias, yet he could not be the Son of God, as he acknowledgeth he is, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe miſerable creatures neither read nor confeſs the Scriptures. For in the ſecond
<hi>Pſalm,</hi> the Meſſias is plainly called the Son of God. <hi>The Lord ſaid unto me, thou art my ſon.</hi> And in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> the ſame Meſſias is clearly expreſt, and called by the great Name of the Lord Jehovah: <hi>They ſhall call him our Righteous Lord,</hi> Jer. 23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This alſo is to be obſerved, that wicked
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> in the worſt act, did not preſume to take the Name of God into his mouth without an addition of praiſe and Benediction. How blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, yea how ungodly then are they amongſt us, who not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raſhly and irreverently name that dreadfull Name of God, but moſt wickedly blaſpheme, mock, and all to beſpit it? If God will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his Name in vain; what ſhall become of them that blaſpheme his Name, and moſt wickedly abuſe it? Let us even from this ungodly
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> learn,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To give more Reverence to Gods Holy Name, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour whereof Chriſt could here no longer hold his peace, leſt he alſo ſhould ſeem to deſpiſe and diſhonour the Sacred Name of God, otherwiſe he would never have anſwered that wicked man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt did therefore anſwer <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> that the Jews in after ages ſhould have no ground to excuſe or defend their treachery, ſaying, That <hi>Nazarene</hi> was examined by our high Prieſt, and was adjured by the holy Name of God to tell whether he were the Meſſias and Son of God, or no, but he held his peace, and could not anſwer a word. If he had told the truth, we would have believed him. And for this reaſon Chriſt would hold his peace no longer. Wherefore in that Chriſt did anſwer now and not before, it is not to be aſcribed to any power of the exorciſm, for what conjuration can prevail againſt God?</p>
               <p>Here we are likewiſe taught, freely to confeſs the truth when we are queſtioned about it. Chriſt denyed not who he was. Let us alſo confeſs who we are.</p>
               <p>Moreover Chriſt did ſo frame his anſwer, that he might both inſinuate the truth, and alſo make it his buſineſs to with-hold them from their malice, who ſought to murther him with the fear of future puniſhment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="223" facs="tcp:171778:143"/> The truth he confeſſeth in two words:
<hi>Thou haſt ſaid it.</hi> And, <hi>I am.</hi> The firſt whereof was ſomewhat obſcure: <hi>Thou haſt ſaid.</hi> But the ſecond was clearer then the Sun. The meaning then is this, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid,</hi> as if he had ſaid, True; it is as thou ſay'ſt. Or, I need not anſwer, ſeeing thou thy ſelf ſaiſt it. Or he doth rather refer it, and ſend him to his own conſcience, <hi>Thou haſt ſaid;</hi> that is, why doſt thou ask that which thou knoweſt well enough already? I need not tell thee what thy own conſcience dictates to thee. Nevertheleſs I ingenuouſly confeſs, that <hi>I am,</hi> what thou at once askeſt and acknowledgeſt, even the Meſſias and the Son of God, who is bleſſed for evermore.</p>
               <p>Chriſt doth here firſt take <hi>Caiaphas</hi> himſelf for a witneſs. Secondly he doth freely confeſs it. Thirdly he doth prove his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion by his aſcention into heaven, which was ſhortly to follow, and by his coming again to Judgement, which is not yet come to paſs. For who can aſcend into heaven, and ſo ſit at the right hand of God in equall power with him? Alſo who can deſcend from the clouds, but this one Jeſus? He therefore without all queſtion muſt needs be the Meſſias and the Son of God, however he was abaſed on earth, and notwithſtanding he did ſuffer ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily at the hands of men. Then indeed he ſtood bound like a Malefactor before <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> (who yet was, is, and ever will be the beſt Benefactor to all men) but ſhortly after they were to ſee him after another manner. For the Apoſtles (who were Jews) ſaw him afterward go up into heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 1. <hi>Stephen</hi> (who alſo was a Jew) ſaw him ſtanding at the right hand of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. We all ſhall ſee him coming out of the clouds as a Judge, and juſtly judging his unjuſt Judges,
<hi>Luke</hi> 21. How can it then be, but that he muſt needs be both the Meſſias and the Son of God? Therefore he doth now warn them of this Judgement to come, if happily he might convert them with fear, whom he could not win or reclaim with his courteſies and innocency. The meaning then is this, You do here accuſe me indeed for a baſe fellow, and endeavour with might and main to cut me off and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy me: but hereafter I will not ſhew my ſelf to you ſo weak and deſpicable. Behold ye ſhall ſee me, that I am the Son of God, ſitting at the right hand of the power of God, equall with God, equally powerfull, in the glory of the Father, coming in the clouds of heaven to judge both the quick and the dead, though
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:171778:144"/> now ye look upon me as the ſon of a man, and ſo wickedly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me as a man, plotting and purpoſing my death: This Judgement I now tell you of beforehand. I warn you of this day at preſent.</p>
               <p>Here he doth fitly compare his firſt and ſecond coming toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The firſt coming of Chriſt was with much reproach and ſcorn among unbelievers, but moſt ſaving to Believers. His other coming will be glorious; very comfortable and joyfull to the godly, but to the wicked it will be moſt terrible.</p>
               <p>But let's hear what good Chriſt did theſe naughty men by this confeſſion of the truth. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> askt the queſtion, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it himſelf: beſides he heard the truth of Chriſt alſo, as alſo the proof of the truth, or of his true confeſſion; ſo that he might well have been ſatisfied. But ſee his carriage. He rents his cloathes, and brawls at Chriſt as if he had committed ſome notorious and hainous crime. He hath ſpoken blaſphemy, ſaith he, that is, he hath ſinned againſt the holy Ghoſt. There needs no further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſation or evidence. All ye that are preſent here in this ſacred Council have heard out of his own mouth this horrible and egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious blaſphemy. Is it not more then too much for any man to ſay, and make himſelf to be the Son of God? Judge ye therefore what puniſhment ſuch a man is worthy to have,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the garments was a good cuſtom among the Jews, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in extream troubles and amazements, and when any thing befell them which they much dreaded, and would by no means ſhould have come upon them. Examples of this kind we have in <hi>Jud.</hi> 11.35. and 2
<hi>Sam.</hi> 1. &amp; chap. 13. &amp; 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 5. Thus this wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> doth here, as if he had ſo abhorred the blaſpheming of Gods name, when there was no fear of God at all in him. The wretched man perceived that Chriſt ſpake this from that Text in <hi>Daniel</hi> 7. where we read that the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and was brought before the antient of daies, and had power to judge given to him. It ſeem'd impoſſible to him that this Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> ſhould be that Son of man. Therefore he doth ſo rave and rage, and ſo earneſtly preſs and call for ſentence to be paſt upon him.</p>
               <p>But ſee the malice and hypocriſie of this high Prieſt. They had often heard Chriſt ſay that he was the Son of God, and that he came down from heaven: and they had as often ſtrove and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:171778:144"/> with him about it, as is clear in
<hi>John</hi> 10. and many other places. But here this <hi>Caiaphas</hi> exclaims at it, and tears his cloathes, as if he had heard ſome new and ſtrange thing from him. And all this he doth in oſtentation, and to ſtir up others more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>This was done by the counſel of God, that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the high Prieſt of the Jews ſhould rend his own cloathes at the Paſſion of Chriſt, when all the enemies could not tear the coat of our Lord; whereby was ſignified, that the Jewiſh Prieſthood ſhould be torn in pieces for the wickedneſs of their high Prieſts, as it is now too much to be feared, that our Prieſthood will be ſhattered and torn for the ſins of our high Prieſts.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Caiaphas</hi> did hypocritically do in renting his cloathes, counterfeiting great ſorrow: That let us do really and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, to wit, grieve heartily for the blaſphemy againſt God, and not only be troubled at it, but uſe all means to withſtand, forbid,
<note place="margin">But ſuch means only as God hath appointed.</note> and puniſh it. What great confuſion are we in, who daily hear blaſphemings, and yet are not a jot troubled at it, nor ſeek to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate and withſtand the wrong offered to the name of God, whereas wicked
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> trembles at that which he did but think was blaſphemy?</p>
               <p>Let us now hear the ſentence of the Council againſt Jeſus. It is ſaid, <hi>They all condemned him,</hi> ſaying, <hi>he is guilty of death.</hi> Who pronounced this ſentence? The Prieſts and Phariſees, the Scribes and Elders, the blindeſt of all men. But why did they paſs this ſentence? Becauſe Chriſt anſwered well, and proved the ſame before by ſigns and miracles, and afterward with reall proof: They were ſwift, and made haſte to ſhed blood. Therefore they were called to the Council.
<hi>Caiaphas</hi> knew very well where and of whom to get votes enough. He knew they would all vote as he would have them. Therefore the Evangeliſt ſaith plainly, that they all condemned Chriſt, not one among ſo many learned, wiſe, and grave men oppoſing it. There was none ſtood up for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, there was no patron for him there, none made his appeal, no man craved further time for him to make his defence: ſo whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were they made and addicted for <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> They all agreed in evil, who could never accord in good. And how oft amongſt us alſo is ſentence given in favour of Princes, Potentates and great men againſt the innocent?</p>

                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:171778:146"/> Thus Chriſt, who ſought the glory of his Father in all things, is ſaid to blaſpheme: and he that was free from all ſin, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed worthy of death. Who ſees not what ſhame they here caſt on Chriſt, when they condemn him to death for a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and ſo impiouſly diſgrace that moſt holy Name, which (<hi>Phil.</hi>
2.) is above every name, at which every knee ſhall bow, and by which only we muſt be ſaved, whereas there is no greater loſs than of a mans name and good report, nor is there any thing that can be outwardly inflicted, will ſo grieve a wiſe man, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and ſhame. <hi>A good name is better then great riches, Prov.</hi> 22.1. Here then is fulfilled what Chriſt in
<hi>David</hi> foretold long ago; <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me, Pſalm.</hi> 69 We were and are Blaſphemers, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence guilty of death. Theſe reproaches were ours, but Chriſt transferr'd them, and took them on himſelf, leſt our conſciences ſhould be tormented with them for ever. Beware therefore O Chriſtian, that thou doſt never blaſpheme Chriſt: for that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach redounds on God himſelf. <hi>For he that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father, John</hi> 5. Wherefore Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth the Jews, ſaying, <hi>Say ye of him whom the Father hath ſanct fied and ſent into the world, Thou blaſphemeſt, becauſe I ſaid, I am the Son of God? John</hi> 10.36. Let us rather give thanks to him, who was judged to death as a blaſphemer for us. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the men that held Jeſus mocked him,
<note place="margin">Buke 22.63. Mat. 26.67.</note> and ſpit in his face, and buffeted him, and covered his face</hi> (Mark 14.65.) <hi>and ſmote him with the palms of their hands, ſaying, Propheſie unto us, thou Chriſt who is he that ſmote thee? And many other things blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly ſpake they againſt him,</hi> Luke 22.65.</p>
               <p>They have condemned Chriſt to death for a blaſphemer. Now they mock him as a fool, and handle him moſt ſhamefully, and exerciſe all kind of deviliſh ſpite upon him. When wicked men have extreamly defamed, and impiouſly dealt with a man, at laſt they jeer him: ſo they firſt make a man a blaſphemer, and then uſe him like a fool. And although nothing doth more ſcandalize and offend carnal men then the infirmity of Chriſt: yet the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> eſteem it the greateſt honour of Chriſt to record this injury offered to him. For his goodneſs and mercy doth ſo much the more appear, by how much the more he was abaſed and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:171778:146"/> for us. And it is ſo much the ſweeter to us, by how much he was made more deſpicable for us. For we may truly glory in his affliction.</p>
               <p>And hence ariſeth our greateſt Conſolation, to ſee that he hath ſo abundantly expiated our pride and rebellion againſt God. Therefore O my ſoul, who art redeemed by the blood of Chriſt, betake thy ſelf into thy chamber, and retire into the cloſet of thy heart, and meditate on thoſe great things which thy Lord endured for thee in that ſhadow of the night. Conſider the words of the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> which though they be few, yet they do fully expreſs the huge affront and indignity offered to Chriſt. <hi>The men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that held Jeſus, mocked him,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe were the ſervants of the High Prieſts, and the Souldiers of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which held Chriſt intangled in their ſnares. To theſe he was now delivered, to do with him as they liſted after the Council had examined him. And they, to gratifie their maſters who ſtood by, loaded him with all the ſcorn and ſhame they could poſſibly deviſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and exerciſed all the fury of their malice without any controll, and no doubt but they received a ſpecial reward after from the High Prieſts, for their great pains taken, and their good ſervice done in mocking Chriſt. In expectation whereof theſe lewd ſervants and Souldiers did ſo much the more glory, the more they could revile, afflict, and laſh him. So that they did cruelly and moſt miſerably uſe the King of Glory all that live-long Night. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They did childiſhly fleer at him, as they uſe to make ſport with fools, abuſing him with moſt contumelious words and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Who is not ſenſible what a horrid thing it was to deride him, whom the Father had ſent for our ſalvation? And yet they now flout and fleer at Chriſt, who likewiſe talk and prate of his Words, and Works, and Sacraments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They ſpit upon him, or ſpit even in his face. To ſpit on a man is far greater diſdain, then ſimply to mock or ſtrike him. For that which we ſpit on, we account a naſty ſtinking thing. Behold, here the bread of Angels is loathſom to men, they abuſe that Face which the Angels deſire to behold; they beſpatter him, whom their Fathers ſo longingly deſired; ſaying, <hi>cauſe thy face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Pſalm 80. Here that of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is truly fulfilled: <hi>He hath no form or comlineſs, and when we ſhall
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:171778:147"/> ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him.</hi> We eſteemed him not. Truly he bare our griefs,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They buffeted him. The <hi>Jews</hi> had a cuſtom, that they thought they could never ſufficiently miſuſe one that had offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and ſo thought that they had performed a moſt accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervice to God, if they had poured out their wrath by ſpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and all ſort of deſpite upon him, then they took themſelves for moſt dear children of God, becauſe they were fervently and burning hot zealous for him, and did ſtoutly vindicate his wrong. Hence they did not bluſh to do thoſe things which the baſeſt fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the world would have been aſhamed of. But they knockt Chriſt on the head, and Satan now doth the like to them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They cover his face: Firſt, that they might not be moved to pitty him: for his face was moſt lovely, and enamored all that beheld it. He was truly fairer then the children of men, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 45. Secondly, They were ſo malicious that they could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe what to do to him. And therefore by the juſt Judgement of God the Veil is yet upon their heart, according to that, <hi>Let their eyes be blinded that they ſee not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. They ſtroke him on the face with the palms of their hands, with ſcoffing words, <hi>Propheſie thou Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. ſpeaking it in ſcorn, as to one that fain would be accounted by the people for a Prophet and the Meſſias, when indeed he was not. And many other they ſpake blaſphemouſly againſt him. Many things, ſaith he, which neither the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> nor the Prophets wrote of. Not ſuch as the former, but other things, ſaith he, they taunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſpake againſt him. And what great, how grievous, and what unheard of things did our Lord ſuffer for us this Night?</p>
               <p>Here that Propheſie was fully verified: <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheekt to them that plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting,</hi> Iſa. 50. Unthankfull man, get thee gone, and ſeek after the joyes of this world, ſince the Lord hath ſuffered ſuch unworthy things for thee. See what ſolace Chriſt had in the Paſchal Night, which was the greateſt and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeſt Feſtival of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold what great thanks he had from his people that Night, wherein he did them the greateſt kindneſs heretofore. That night they did ſprinkle their Door-poſts with the blood of the old Lamb. But they beſmear this true Lamb with moſt execrable
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:171778:147"/> and curſed ſpittings. O the ſtrange frowardneſs of men! O un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable patience of Chriſt! O the never ſufficiently admired patience of God! Had it been any wonder if he had even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed the whole world for this one horrid fact? Truly the Lord is very patient and long-ſuffering. But thus the Scriptures muſt be fulfilled, and thus man muſt be Redeemed. As for our part, Dear Brethren, let us,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider ſeriouſly all and every of theſe Premiſes &amp; parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, for no man can with words ever ſufficiently expreſs them. Conſider them every one in order. Compare the perſecutors with him that was perſecuted. Think of them as if they were now before your eyes, and done afreſh in your ſight; meditate upon them in the inmoſt parts of your heart. Thy Saviour is ſet at naught, They Maſter is ſpit on, Thy Lord is buffeted. Thy God is more baſely handled than ever any man was dealt with on earth. Hear this, underſtand it, conſider it well, ponder it throughly, whoſoever thou art that doſt acknowledge thy ſelf to be a ſinner. For they are our ſins. Brethren, I ſay, our ſins are they that brought Chriſt to this paſs. If we had not ſinned in <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve,</hi> our innocent Chriſt had never ſuffered theſe things. In this various and manifold Paſſion we ſee as before our eyes, how unrighteous, how guilty, how full of ſin we are, and eſpecially have been. Look how vile Chriſt outwardly in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy did appear or ſeem before men, ſo vile were we inwardly in our ſouls before God; and ſuch as Chriſt was here, ſuch muſt we have been for ever, if he had not undertaken all theſe things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us give him thanks, who by his reproach and contempt delivered us from eternal ſhame.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Learn we alſo patiently to bear what wrong and ſcorn is offered to us. For if our Lord Chriſt was thus mocked, ſpit on, ſcoft at, contemned, and made a laughing ſtock, (as he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told his Apoſtles he ſhould, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.) and was beaten with more ſtripes then any can expreſs, why ſhould not we his ſervants and ſchollers ſuffer the like? This &amp; no other way muſt we go to Heaven: even by death to life by ſhame to glory. He that refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth this, when according to the will of God, to do it, may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a prudent man indeed, but he will never go for a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Know therefore, that Chriſt did not ſuffer theſe things <hi>only</hi> as his work, but alſo for our Example: that is, He did not

For they buffet him, who confeſs him with their words, but deny him in their works. A buffet is that which is given behind the back. They ſpit on Chriſt, who defile their ſouls with filthy thoughts, or laugh at godly men for ſerving God. Or laſtly, ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn their true Prelates or Miniſters. They ſtrike Chriſt on his face with the palms of their bands, who diſturb and vex their Neighbour in his preſence, and before his face; or that take the Sacraments, or adminiſter them with unwaſhen hands. They cover Chriſts face, who, when they ſin in ſecret, are more afraid of men then of God. Alſo they who ſin out of wilfull and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected ignorance.

By theſe Calves and Bulls, which were counted clean creatures, are meant the <hi>Jews,</hi> who firſt faſtened upon Chriſt, and were the prime Authors of his ſufferings. Now you ſhall hear how that was fulfilled in Chriſt, which <hi>David</hi> in the ſame

<hi>Jews,</hi> &amp;c. who ſat in this Council, and by this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill delivered up Jeſus to the civil Magiſtrate as one guilty and worthy of death. For ſo ſaith the Text:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When the morning was come,</hi> (Mat. 27 1.) <hi>all the chief Prieſts, and Scribes, and the Elders of the people, and the whole Council,</hi> (Mar. 15.1.) <hi>came together</hi> (Luke 22 66.) <hi>againſt Jeſus to put him to death, And led him into their Council, ſaying, Art thou the Chriſt? Tell us. And he ſaid unto them, if I tell you, you will not believe: and if I alſo ask you, you will not anſwer me, nor let me go. Hereafter ſhall the ſon of Man ſit on the right hand of the power of God. Then ſaid they all; Art thou then the Son of God? And he ſaid unto them, ye ſay that I am. And they ſaid, what need we any further witneſſes? for we our ſelves have heard of his own mouth. And the whole multitude of them aroſe,</hi> (Luke 23.1.) <hi>and led Jeſus bound from</hi> Caiaphas
<hi>into the Hall of Judgement, and delivered him to</hi> Pontius Pilate
<hi>the Governour,</hi> (Matth. 27.2. John 18.28.)</p>
               <p>All theſe things yet paſſed in the houſe of
<hi>Caiaphas.</hi> The Council held all night. But toward the morning it grew more hot and fierce, and they now flock together in ſwarms. For now the news of Chriſt being taken was noyſed all abroad. Their rage encreaſed, and the better Chriſt anſwered, the more outragious were they. The more patiently he bore their inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the more they vexed at him. Therefore as ſoon as it was day-light, they conſult again what was requiſite to be done.
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:171778:151"/> Theſe prying buſie-bodies miſt their aym, and this Nocturnal and dark Council came ſhort of ſufficient evidence to accuſe him as guilty of death before <hi>Pilate.</hi> Although there were men, and they wiſe ones too, yea enemies, yet could they not invent or forge any thing ſo much as like a crime againſt the innocency of Chriſt and his Goſpel, which they ſought to condemn and cut off. He confeſſed that he was the Son of God: but that was not a ſufficient cauſe or ground enough to accuſe him before a <hi>Pagan</hi> Judge and an Idolater. Therefore they call the Council together again, if peradventure they might find out ſomething more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly whereof to accuſe him before the Governour. Chriſt therefore is brought bound again before them, that ſo they might even ſatiate and glut their wicked, cruel, and greedy eyes, at leaſt by gazing and ſtaring upon his miſery.

<hi>Jews:</hi> nor did the wonted day break forth before their eyes, and ſhine upon them; but a night of black darkneſs and blindneſs covered and fell upon them. This morning threw down their Temple and Altar, cut off their Prophets, took from them their Kingdom and Prieſthood, and turned all their Feſtivals into an eternal lamentation and wo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that juſtly too, foraſmuch at that day they began their barbarous and bloody Counſel like mad dogs and ſavage beaſts, that they might deliver the Author of Life and Lord of Glory unto death.</p>
               <p>They preſs it therefore upon him further, and urge him yet once more, whether he were the Chriſt and the Meſſiah? They knew that the Meſſias was ſo promiſed in the Scriptures, that he ſhould be the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which if Chriſt had confeſſed, then they knew they ſhould have juſt cauſe to accuſe him for a Traytor, and as one that intended to rebell againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as this queſtion, <hi>Whether Jeſus was the Chriſt,</hi> held in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate all night untill the morning: ſo is it yet canvaſſed, and doth ſtill remain doubtfull with the <hi>Jews.</hi> This is it that is the ſcruple now, and doth moſt perplex and trouble them,
<hi>viz.</hi> who and where the Meſſias ſhould be, and when he ſhould come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>

<hi>Nazareth</hi> to be that Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias. As for our part we need not queſtion any ſuch thing: for we believe and know that he is the true Chriſt and Meſſias, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. Nor do we, or ever will we believe any other, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.</p>
               <p>Chriſt therefore when he was asked again, makes almoſt the ſame anſwer as he did before, except what <hi>Luke</hi> addeth, that he ſaid this more, <hi>If I tell you, you will not believe, and if I ask you, ye will not anſwer me, nor let me go.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This wiſe and well contrived evaſion doth ſufficiently hint out what wicked Judges were in this Council, ſuch as would hear nothing that was juſt and true, and who knew nothing but how to oppreſs and condemn.

A man ſhall get nothing of ſuch men, nor prevail any thing with them, no though God himſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>No good could have been expected from them, although Chriſt had ſpoken never ſo excellently of the Incarnate Word: ſurely nothing but ſcorn and blaſphemy had come of it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently greater wrath and rage in theſe furious men. And it had been to as little purpoſe, if he had askt them about thoſe Prophetical Scriptures, none of them would or could have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him. What did they anſwer him, when he askt them about
<hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm? <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. And ſo concerning the ſon of
<hi>David,</hi> and of that <hi>verſe</hi> in the <hi>Pſalms, The Lord ſaid to my Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo when he asked them, <hi>whether it was lawfull to heal on the Sabbath Day?</hi> Mat. 22. Luke 14. Chriſt muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer either as one accuſed, or ask as one contriving his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
               <p>The belief of his Judges was requiſite to his anſwer, but to his queſtion their anſwer only was ſufficient. But in this Council Chriſt had neither credit given to his words, nor an anſwer to his queſtions; why they ſhould he ſpeak much, eſpecially ſeeing he knew that they were peremptorily and obſtinately reſolved to kill him, and never more to let him ſcape alive out of their hands?
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:171778:152"/> And indeed how ſhould they believe the words of Jeſus, who would not believe his Divine Works, which were more effectual to perſwade.</p>
               <p>Therefore this was a time to keep ſilence: ſo that he anſwered nothing, but <hi>Ye ſay ſo:</hi> by which reply he doth ſend them again to their own conſciences. Beſides he doth thereby again incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, that they muſt come to judgement for what they did.
<hi>Hereafter,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the ſon of Man ſhall ſit,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>q.d.</hi> I ſhall ſay no more but this, the time will come when ye ſhall ſee me Judge you and all the world, though now you moſt unjuſtly Judge me. At this they made a fearfull and hideous out-cry again:
<hi>What need we any further witneſs? we our ſelves have heard out of his own mouth.</hi> And what was it, O ye blind and wicked men, which ye did hear from his own mouth? I dare ſay you heard no blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy come out of his mouth, for which he deſerved death, but an awfull reverence of Gods Name, for which he was much to be honoured: and will ye for all that paſs ſentence of death againſt him? Are ye ſo forward to commit that grand ſin, even to murther the innocent Son of God? O ye High Prieſts, and ſons of
<hi>Aaron,</hi> whats become of your Unction now? Where is your Clemency? Have ye caſt away all pity and compaſſion from you? <hi>David</hi> could not go forward with the Temple, becauſe he had ſhed the blood of enemies: and dare ye who offer Sacrifices dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ye that ſo ſwell, and are puffed up with ſuch a conceit of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, who glory in the ſanctimony of your life and height of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; how dare you, I ſay, to paſs ſentence upon that moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and ſpotleſs one, the very Fountain of life, as one worthy of death? <hi>Herod</hi> who was a ſtranger, and otherwiſe a very bloody beaſt, yet gave him more reverence then ye, and would not pollute his hands with the blood of this harmleſs man. <hi>Pilate</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that barbarous bruit was terribly afraid, and excuſed himſelf, and waſht his hands from his blood. But you, (and ſhall like your holineſs) you holy high Prieſts affirm that he is guilty of death. O the Religion, O the Righteouſneſs that ſhines in you! Doubtleſs the very Heathen, and the
<hi>Samaritans</hi> will be your Judges: Nay out of your own mouth ſhall ye be judged, how much your ungodlineſs hath beed more cruell then the unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate.</hi> But let us leave thoſe vile men, and proceed. The concluſion of that bloody Counſell was: Jeſus
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:171778:153"/> of <hi>Nazareth</hi> doth deſerve to die. The reaſon is, becauſe he proved himſelf to be the Meſſias, and the Son of the living God, who is bleſſed for ever; and that by the very Teſtimony of their own conſciences, beſides the Signs and Wonders which he had wrought. This was the Judgement which was given by thoſe holy
<hi>Phariſees</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in that Counſell. And now they have no need of any more evidence. For they carryed their own cauſe, but Jeſus loſt his. Wherefore they hale him out of hand before the ſecular Court, and ſet him before the <hi>Roman</hi> Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour bound with cords, chained, ſpit on; and therefore irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cably determined to be worthy of death: the ſcullions and raf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcallions, with a great concourſe and clamour of the people eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging on againſt him: that it might be fulfilled which Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. <hi>The ſon of man ſhall be delivered to the chief Prieſts, and they ſhall condemn him to death, and ſhall deliver him to the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles. This they now fulfill. <hi>The whole multitude,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>aroſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> to ſet the fairer gloſs upon the proceedings, that their cauſe might ſeem to be the more juſt and honeſt. Then they preſent him bound to the Governour, thereby to ſhew that they had condemned him already. They carry all things with much pomp and ſtate, that ſo they might the better cloak their hatred and malice.</p>
               <p>Lo here he that came to looſe all mens bonds, is now the third time bound himſelf. He is often bound and manicled, becauſe we had many fetters and chains which he was to break with his bonds. Here then let us a little remember and conſider our ſelves. For as Chriſt is here brought to his Judgement and Trial for life and death, by one conſent and with great rejoycing of his Adverſaries, without any mercy or pity, without all hope of acquitment or releaſe, no man owning him, or oppoſing the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt him: ſo ſhould we have been brought before Gods dreadfull Tribunal, if Chriſt had not put himſelf in our place, and ſtood in our ſtead: Wherefore if thou wouldſt ſtand with boldneſs in Gods Judgement, caſt thy ſelf on Chriſt by Faith. For without him none can ſtand before God in the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>For no man living is juſtified, or found righteous before God,</hi> Pſalm 143.2. Let us therefore follow our Lord Chriſt alſo, as he was toſſed too and fro, from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to
<hi>Pilate,</hi> from the ſpiritual Court to the civil Magiſtrate, from the
<hi>Jews</hi> to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:171778:153"/> from the wicked to the ungodly, from the ſuperſtitious to the Idolaters. Nor is there any cauſe why we ſhould be afraid. All things ſhall work for our good in the end. But firſt let us hear what end <hi>Judas</hi> came to, who was the Ring-leader and incendi a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all this miſchief. It follows in <hi>Matthew:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> Judas <hi>which betrayed him,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.3.</note> when he ſaw that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, repented himſelf, and brought again the thirty pieces of ſilver to the chief Prieſts and Elders, ſaying, I have ſinned, in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And they ſaid, what is that to us? ſee thou to that. And he caſt down the pieces of ſilver in the Temple, and departed, and went and hanged himſelf. (And he burſt aſunder in the midſt, and all his bowels guſhed out,</hi> Act. 1.18.) <hi>And the chief Preſts took the ſilver pieces, and ſaid, It is not lawfull for us to put them into the Treaſury, becauſe it is the price of blood. And they took Counſell, and bought with thoſe (ſilver pieces, the reward of iniquity,</hi> Act. 1.18.)
<hi>the potters field, to bury ſtrangers in. And it was known unto all the dwellers at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>inſomuch as that field is called in their proper tongue,</hi> Aceldama, <hi>that is, the field of blood unto this day,</hi> Act. 1.19. <hi>Then was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that which was ſpoken by</hi> Jeremy <hi>the Prophet, ſaying,</hi> And they took the thirty pieces of ſilver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> did value: And gave them for the Potters field, as the Lord had appointed me.</p>
               <p>This part of the Hiſtory is inſerted by <hi>Matthew,</hi> that we may firſt hear the juſt Judgement of God upon the Traytor, before we hear the unrighteous ſentence of <hi>Pilate</hi> againſt Chriſt that was betrayed.</p>
               <p>And this miſerable man muſt firſt dye. For he was not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to live ſo long, till Chriſt had dyed for the ſins of men. There is a two-fold ſenſe of what is ſaid: <hi>When he ſaw that he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He either knew by certain ſigns and conjectures that Chriſt would now be condemned, inaſmuch as he was led to the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat, from whence none return acquitted, and for that he knew that the malice of the <hi>Iews</hi> toward him was implacable. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">2. He ſaw him to be but a damned creature for ſuch an hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and horrible fact, as if he then firſt began to feel the weight of his ſin. The Devil will not let them whom he tempted ſee the hainouſneſs of ſin till they have committed it. But when the ſin
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:171778:154"/> is once acted, then he will aggravate it, and no leſs endeavour to throw them headlong into deſpair, then he did before hurry them to ſin. <hi>Judas</hi> therefore being now ſenſible of his ſin, repents him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: which repentance <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith was too late, and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith it was to no purpoſe. For he did not repent according to knowledge, ſaith <hi>Origen:</hi> He did not bewail his ſin, but his loſs. This was the repentance of <hi>Cain, Saul, Ahab, Eſau.</hi> Wicked men are ſorry that they are come into trouble and anguiſh of mind, and if they can once get out of their ſtreights, they will make but light of their ſin. Beſides this repentance of <hi>Judas</hi> was not ſound and true; for although he acknowledged his ſin, yet he did not hope or believe in Gods mercy.</p>
               <p>His ſin was revealed to him, but not the Goſpel: This is the repentance of them who by the righteous Judgement of God are damned, ſeeing indeed, and acknowledging their ſin, but not daring to beg pardon for the ſame. But true repentance is, to judge or condemn, and believe. Now to judge or make judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is to acknowledge ones ſelf to be a ſinner, to condemn, rebuke, confeſs, and puniſh or mortifie ones ſins: but to believe, is to truſt and relye upon God by Chriſt, that he will not impute the ſin, but pardon it. Thus did <hi>David,</hi> Pſalm 32. <hi>I ſaid I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt,</hi> &amp;c. Again, <hi>Many are the ſorrows of the wicked: but he that truſteth in the Lord, mercy ſhall compaſs him about.</hi> So the Wiſe man: <hi>For if we ſin we are thine;
<note place="margin">Wiſd. 15.</note> knowing that we are accounted as thine.</hi> This Faith in Gods mercy through Chriſt is moſt neceſſary to ſalvation and the remiſſion of ſins. For when a man knows that Chriſt is the true Saviour, the pledge of Righteouſneſs, the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Mercy; he will hie and betake himſelf to Him, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the hugeneſs and exceſs of his ſins. <hi>By his knowledge ſhall he juſtifie many,</hi> Iſa. 53. And again, <hi>To know thee is perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Wiſd. 15.3. Therefore if thou art terrified with the remembrance of thy ſins, thou oughteſt not to look upon the greatneſs of them only, but alſo to conſider and have reſpect to the mercy of God in Chriſt; otherwiſe with <hi>Cain</hi> thou wilt cry out full of fear and deſpair: <hi>My ſin is greater then can be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given,</hi> Gen. 4. Thus
<hi>David</hi> begins his penitential <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. <hi>with remembrance of Divine mercy, which makes ſcarlet ſins like ſnow,</hi> Iſa. 1.
<hi>Judas</hi> periſhed becauſe he had not this repentance,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:171778:154"/> nor did he know what it was.
<hi>Peters</hi> converſion was a Token of Gods mercy: So <hi>Judas</hi>'s damnation was a ſignal of his wrath. God of his goodneſs grant that the like never happen to any Chriſtian, but help us rather to ſeek for Grace by true Faith, and with our whole heart.</p>
               <p>But what doth <hi>Judas</hi> do more? He brought back the thirty pieces of ſilver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See here this wicked <hi>Judas</hi> made reſtitution of his unjuſt gain: but he was never the better for it, becauſe he believed not. To ſhew us that all our good works without Faith are nothing worth in the ſight of God. The wretched man could not long keep that money which he had ſold Chriſt for: for a ſign, that all thoſe good things which God of his bounteous liberality had formerly beſtowed upon the <hi>Iews,</hi> ſhould ere long be taken from them again. God had given them the Lands of the Heathens, that they might keep his Statutes, and obſerve his Laws, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 105. <hi>ult.</hi> and becauſe they did not ſo, he ſaid, <hi>I will return, and take away my corn and my wine,</hi> Hoſ. 2.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Judas</hi> did not only repent and reſtore his ill gotten goods, but confeſſed his fault too: <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> ſaid he,
<hi>in betraying the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And yet he was nothing the better for his confeſſion, and all becauſe he believed not. Yet is it of much advantage to us. For this one Teſtimony of it ſelf is ſufficient for us againſt all the blaſphemies of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Firſt, The Traytor himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth Chriſt. Secondly, He that denyed him repented, and was converted. Thirdly, <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf who was the Judge could find no fault in him. Fourthly, And what is yet more, the chief Prieſts and Scribes themſelves could not tell what to ſay, when <hi>Judas</hi> confeſſed that Chriſt was innocent, but only reply, ſo as that they did upon the matter yield, that what <hi>Judas</hi> ſaid of Chriſts innocency was true; Say they, <hi>What is that to us? ſee thou to it.</hi> Which words of theirs ſound as if they began now to doubt what they had done. But all the blame they lay on <hi>Iudas</hi> the Traytor: which they would never have done, had they known that what he did had been warrantable and juſt. And yet how coldly do they anſwer, when they hear of innocent blood? As if they would fain have ſaid; If it be righteous blood, what is that to us? We bought and ſold: we paid what we promiſed. Therefore there can be no flaw againſt us at the Law. Look thou to it, whom thou didſt ſell, it nothing conterns us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:171778:155"/> But hear, O ye Heads and Rulers of the Synagogue. Ye dealt either juſtly, or unjuſtly with Chriſt. If unjuſtly, (as tis plain enough that ye did) then are ye Chriſt-killers, that is, ſuch as murther your own Meſſias. If ye did juſtly with him, then ought ye to have comforted poor miſerable <hi>Iudas,</hi> and not have heaped all the guilt upon him, and laid all the load on his back: but ingenuouſly have confeſt that he was in no fault at all. But whereas ye ſhift of the blame from your ſelves, and lay it on <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> certainly you acknowledge that he did very wickedly. And if his Treaſon were a filthy fact, doubtleſs your murther could not be lawfull nor juſt, and ſo ye are manifeſtly convinced of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and that out of your own mouth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Note here, what wicked men will do againſt their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſo they may but ſatisfie their luſt. They deny not but that it was guiltleſs blood that was betrayed. Wherefore hence we may obſerve, to whom the poor ſheep may ſafely commit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Theſe ſhould have comforted his conſcience that was driven into deſpair: but they ſay, what is that to us? O tender hearted Shepheards! Here we ſee little of that affection that was in <hi>Moſes</hi> toward the people,
<hi>Exod.</hi> 32. And in <hi>Paul</hi> to his Brethren, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. They are indeed no Shepheards, but Wolves rather, ſeeking their own, and not the good of the Lords Flock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Obſerve here, that they who do evil to pleaſe men, if the wind turn, and things fall out contrary, they ſhall be flouted and forſaken by thoſe very men for whoſe favour they did it. Let no man therefore at any time do evil to humour others, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What ſhould <hi>Indas</hi> do now being terrified in conſcience, and finding no comfort from thoſe men whoſe turn he had ſerved againſt his own conſcience? What elſe, I ſay, ſhould he do, or what indeed could he do, but deſpair? Wherefore he caſt down the pieces of ſilver in the Temple, and went and hanged himſelf, being forced ſo to do by that ſorrow which is unto death, (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.) and that by the righteous Judgement of God, that ſo the wickedneſs which he fomented againſt the Head of all the Saints, might fall on his own pate, and that he ſhould be his own judge and Executioner. Now,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He hanged himſelf, to ſhew that he was hated of heaven and earth, who would not only not reform and amend that ſin of
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:171778:155"/> Treaſon, but alſo added this horrid offence, to be his own mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He hung in the ayr, died and burſt a ſunder in the midſt, and all his bowels guſhed out, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Act.</hi> 1. for he was not worthy of a burial: Indeed he was not fit for the company either of Angels or men: Therefore he could finde no place in heaven among the Angels, becauſe he betrayed the Lord of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of the Angels: nor ought he to be buried in the earth amongſt men, becauſe when he was on earth, he was a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Devils; juſtly then did he periſh in the ayr, which is the place appointed for the Devils, until the day of Judgement.</p>
               <p>A figure of this untimely death we have in <hi>Achitophel,</hi> who plotted the death and ruine of <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. who came to the ſame end as <hi>Judas</hi> here did, for he hanged himſelf, and for no other reaſon, but becauſe he foreſaw that <hi>David</hi> would get the Kingdom, in that <hi>Chuſhi Davids</hi> Friend was come over to
<hi>Abſolon</hi> not cordially, but only perſonally. So <hi>Judas</hi> ſaw that Chriſts name would not be forgotten, in that the Apoſtles yet live to keep up the remembrance thereof, and would ſurvive that his memory ſhould not periſh. As therefore <hi>Achitophels</hi> hanging himſelf was a ſad preſage that <hi>Abſolon</hi> himſelf alſo ſhould come to an ill end: So <hi>Judas</hi> hanging himſelf portended the end and deſtruction of the <hi>Jews;</hi> for unto this very day they hang yet between heaven and earth, becauſe in heaven they have no hope, and on earth have not any ſetled place; and their bowels are guſhed out, for they are ſcattered over the face of all the earth. Now whereas it is here ſaid, that
<hi>Judas</hi> brought back the 30. pieces of ſilver to the Prieſts into the Temple: it is plain,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That ſome of the Prieſts and Elders tarried in the Temple becauſe of the Feaſt, whilſt others of the chief Prieſts and El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders accuſed Chriſt before <hi>Pilate.</hi> For the Sacrifices of the Feaſt muſt be taken care of; and if no other, yet the morning Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which was the daily offering, muſt be lookt after, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be now left undone, but that in both they might hold up the Service of God, both by their Oblations in the Temple, and by condemning Chriſt that grand Seducer, who is indeed the Saviour of the world. Hence we ſee how juſtly their Sacrifices were rejected <hi>(Iſa.</hi> 1.) <hi>Becauſe your hands,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>are full of blood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:171778:156"/> 2. Here alſo we may ſee what a fearfull thing it is to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God. For he that is deſerted of God, hath indeed a ſenſe of his ſin, but he dares not hope for any mercy or pardon for his ſin, nor can he finde any comfort from men, but muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily run into deſpair.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We ſee alſo what a miſerable end they come unto, who are the perſecutors of Chriſt, <hi>they hang between heaven and earth.</hi> They loſe earthly things, and cannot obtain heavenly.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But let covetous men principally mark well this paſſage; for here they may ſee what becomes of their covetouſneſs: For what profit or pleaſure had this miſerable <hi>Judas</hi> by all the money that he took? Surely he got nothing but grief and ſorrow of heart. Riches are a perpetual vexation, although thou get them with diſtracting care, and fill all thy Store-houſes therewith, ſcraping them together by all means, right or wrong: What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of all at laſt? Thou loſeſt thy money, bringeſt thy body to poverty, and betrayeſt thy ſoul to the Devil. And therefore, O Chriſtian, take better heed, and let not money maſter thee; but if thou haſt got it honeſtly, uſe it ſoberly; if diſhoneſtly, be careful to diſpoſe of it to good uſes, or make reſtitution to thoſe thou haſt wronged.</p>
               <p>But whence had <hi>Judas</hi> all this money? And what became of it at laſt? Doubtleſs the Jewiſh Prelates being in a confuſion were forced to pick up the money again which he ſcattered in the Temple, inaſmuch as it came from them at firſt; but when they had it, they could not tell what in the world to do with it. But it was the leaſt of their thoughts to take care for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the Traitor when he had cleared Chriſts innocency. They ſaw that <hi>Judas</hi> repented and recanted what he had done, and returned again the earneſt and contract of the bargain which he made. But they keep the Merchandize which they bought, and the money too; all which was juſt and honeſt in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Nevertheleſs their ſtomacks did a little riſe againſt that money, and they call it the price of blood: whereby we may clearly ſee that the worm of their conſcience did begin to ſting them: wherefore they would not put this money into the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, becauſe it was ill gotten goods; thus they did ſtrain at a Gnat, and ſwallow a Camel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. Whereas if they thought that money to be prophane and unholy, not fit to be imployed
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:171778:156"/> about any uſe for the Temple, becauſe it was the price of blood; Why then did they ſhed that blood? And why did not they themſelves refrain the Altar and Temple, as being defiled with blood? but this they make light of, and count it no ſin, they can ſwallow this Camel, though they are at a ſtand what to do with the money, this is the righteouſneſs of the Phariſees.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Corban</hi> in the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tongue, ſignifieth a Gift offered, whence the Cheſt, Box, or Coffer in which ſuch Oblations or Offerings were laid up, were called by that name, the thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, being put for the thing contained.</p>
               <p>And that this money may be well beſtowed and laid out again, they buy part of a field with it of a certain Potter to bury ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in. Juſt like thoſe who rob and cheat the poor, and then throw away a drib of it to paint the Church, or buy ſome tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling ornament for the Temple, forſooth, whereby they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to expunge and waſh away their ſin, but all the while they will not abate one jot of their Covetouſneſs and Cruelty. But,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>1. This came to paſs by the providence of God, that the price of our Saviour ſhould not be laviſht on the State and pomp of Sinners, but ſerve for the reſt, ſuccour and refreſhment of Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: that Chriſt by ſhedding his blood might redeem the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and by the price of his paſſion might recover and raiſe up the dead.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Nor doth it want a myſterie that the Potters field ſhould be bought. God is that Potter, who of the duſt of the earth did make and faſhion the veſſels of our bodies; the field is the Lords Inheritance. So then the field of this Potter is purchaſed by the blood of Chriſt, and that for Strangers; for true Reſt and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life is obtained for thoſe that are truly ſtrangers in this world, by the blood of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>But although Hoſpitality be a good and pious Work, and Chriſtians ought eſpecially to obſerve this, that they entertain ſtrangers and cheriſh them, and to bury their dead decently, yet it is left as a perpetual blot upon the Jews: and it had been far better for them if that money had been laid up in the Treaſury; for ſo their reproach might one way or other have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, but now their ſhame lies open to all the world; for God ſo ordering it, that field is not called <hi>Xebergerim,</hi> that is, a place
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:171778:157"/> to bury Strangers in; but
<hi>Hakaldama,</hi> which after the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> is <hi>the field of blood:</hi> this is continually caſt in their teeth; and they muſt hear on't whether they will or no; nor have they got them much honour by purchaſing a Burying place for Strangers: but thus it muſt be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled in <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary,</hi> who propheſied long ſince in the perſon of Chriſt, after this manner: <hi>And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I the Meſſias ſaid to the Jews, If ye think good, give me my price; if not, forbear; ſo they weighed for my price thirty pieces of ſilver. And the Lord ſaid unto me, Caſt them to the Potter: a goodly price, that I was prized at of them,</hi> Zach. 11. <hi>And I took the thirty pieces of ſilver, and I caſt them to the potter in the Temple of the Lord.</hi> In this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie we hear not only of the thirty pieces of ſilver, but of throwing them in the Temple too, as alſo of the Potter; ſo that it is no leſs than a Miracle that the Scriptures of the Prophets and Evangeliſts ſhould ſo agree together, which is a great confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Faith. Chriſt calls theſe thirty pieces of ſilver his price, becauſe he was bought and ſold for juſt ſo much and no more: and becauſe this was ſo ſmall, contemptible, and ridiculous a ſumm, God the Father bade him caſt it to the Potter, and doth Ironically call it, a
<hi>goodly price,</hi> which ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a perſon was valued at. What the Lord there <hi>commanded</hi> to be done, the Evangeliſt here ſaith, as the Lord <hi>appointed</hi> me. And whereas the Prophet ſaith, that he did do ſo, it is as much as to ſay, he foretold that all things ſhould ſo fall out. And whereas the Evangeliſt ſaith further, whom they of the children of
<hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> did value, it ſeems to have reſpect to the Hiſtory of
<hi>Joſeph</hi> who was ſold, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37. For ſo the froward and ſtubborn chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Abraham</hi> bought him of the children of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, of <hi>Judas</hi> and his Aſſociates; the Iſhmaelites bought him of the Iſraelites, one wicked man of another as bad as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Nor let it trouble any man, that <hi>Matthew</hi> doth here put
<hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi> for <hi>Zachary,</hi> for either one name is put for another in the Greek copies, or elſe this <hi>Zachary</hi> had two names, as we know many others had. But ſome are of opinion, that <hi>Matthew</hi> hath reſpect here to the 22. or 33. <hi>ch.</hi> of <hi>Ieremy.</hi> Let theſe things paſs, for they profit not much: we ſhould rather ſtudy to be thankful unto Chriſt, who bought an inheritance for us Strangers with
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:171778:157"/> his own blood, of the Father, who is our former and faſhioner, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. <hi>Ier.</hi> 18. It follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then led they Jeſus from</hi> Caiaphas <hi>unto the Hall of judgement;
<note place="margin">Joh. 18.28.</note> and they themſelves went not into the judgement Hall, leſt they ſhould be defiled, but that they might eat the Paſsover.</hi> Pilate <hi>then went out unto them, and ſaid, What accuſation bring you againſt this man? They anſwered, and ſaid unto him, If he were not a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, we would not have delivered him up unto thee. Then ſaid</hi> Pilate <hi>unto them, Take ye him, and judge him according to your Law. The Jews therefore ſaid unto him, It is not lawfull for us to put any man to death, that the ſaying of Jeſus might be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, which he ſpake, ſignifying what death he ſhould die.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moſt dear Brethren, we have now followed Chriſt to the very Judgement Hall of <hi>Pilate:</hi> I wiſh we could follow him a little further without croſs, as we now follow him in heart &amp; thought. Now that
<hi>Pilate</hi> was a very potent man, and a kinde of a petty Prince, whom
<hi>Tiberius Caeſar</hi> had ſent at that time to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to be the chief Governour and Ruler of the Jews Country. His ſirname, or rather his fore-name, was <hi>Pontius,</hi> perhaps it was from the Country, which is called <hi>Pontus</hi> near <hi>Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Bythinia.</hi> The houſe in which he lived at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was called
<hi>Praetorium,</hi> the Judgement Hall, after the cuſtom of the
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> or the houſe of the <hi>Praetor,</hi> although indeed he had much more Authority and power then any of the <hi>Roman Praetors</hi> ever had. And no doubt but he was a man of very great command and prudence. Which doth moſt plainly appear by this Hiſtory, in that he behaved himſelf far more juſt and upright than all the High Prieſts, Prieſts and Phariſees of the Jews.</p>
               <p>The Jews then bring Chriſt to <hi>Pilates</hi> Judgement Hall, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that if they did not put him to death themſelves, the guilt of the Fact would not be imputed to them. Nor is be brought thither by one or two, but by all of them together, that ſo by their preſence and multitude they might both amaze the Judge, and vex and grieve Chriſt the more with their envy. But they (forſooth the Prieſts) out of an implanted and inbred hypocriſie; whereby they were ever ſuperſtitiouſly obſervant of ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but altogether neglecting the weightier things, would not go into the Judgement Hall for fear of being defiled, but that they might eat the Paſſeover, as if hitherto they had nothing
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:171778:158"/> polluted themſelves at all by their unworthy dealing with Chriſt, or as if the houſe only of an uncircumciſed man would contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate their Sanctity, whereas they ſpare not by all ways and means to hunt and chaſe the innocent to death. They had a murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous minde, and murtherous tongues; they bribed the Traitor, they hired a Band of Souldiers, they procured falſe Witneſſes, they forged falſe accuſations. Beſides, they urge and threaten the Judge, and yet all this while they wipe their mouth, and what have they done, they are pure and clean, and fit to celebrate the Paſſeover, but upon no other ground, but becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained to go into the Judgement Hall. A moſt egregious purity indeed, or rather a ſtupid and ſordid blindneſs: could another mans houſe pollute them, and would not their own wickedneſs defile them? See how cleanly theſe hypocrites are, how neat they make the outſide of the cup, when the inſide is full of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous cruelty, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. See the prepoſterous and diſorderly righteouſneſs of theſe men, which conſiſted not at all in the heart, but altogether in the outward ſhew: painted Sepulchers they were. Their righteouſneſs alſo conſiſted only in obſerving mens Traditions, as though the precepts of God did conduce nothing to purity and righteouſneſs. It was an Humane conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that no Jew ſhould go into the houſe of any uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed man, that the unclean and uncircumciſed might not defile him. But Gods Law was, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate, thou ſhalt not kill, thou ſhalt not bear falſe witneſs:</hi> This Law of God the Jews violate and contemn, whilſt they are zealous of mens Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances. Thus the greater part among us rely more upon hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane conſtitutions only, and from thence flatter themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a conceit of righteouſneſs, and yet wholly ſleighting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God, as being of no account with them. Againſt theſe the 23. <hi>chapter</hi> of
<hi>Matthew</hi> was written, as well as againſt the hypocrites of old among the Jews. For although for the moſt part they are wholly wicked, yet they cloak and hide their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs juſt as the Jews here did, with obedience to mens Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Who would not have thought that they were a very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly people, and ſo had juſt cauſe againſt Chriſt, who with ſo great Devotion and Religion did obſerve the Canons and conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Holy Fathers? If they make conſcience to keep a good mans Law, how much leſs are they to be ſuſpected to break
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:171778:158"/> Gods commands? You ſee their hypocriſie: But Chriſt taught us another manner of righteouſneſs, when he ſaid, <hi>Sanctifie them, O Father, with the truth,</hi> Joh. 17. That is true Sanctification, when the Father poſſeſſeth our hearts, renewing and enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with the knowledge of Chriſt, Faith, and the remiſſion of ſins. The fleſh will not acknowledge this ſanctification, but conceiteth ſome carnal kinde of holineſs made up by abſtinence from certain meats, and the company of ſome ſort of men, as the Jews here did, neglecting the true righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>Now whereas it is ſaid, <hi>That they might eat the Paſsover,</hi> it is not to be underſtood of the Paſchal Lamb, which they did eat the night before, but of the unleavened bread, which they uſe to eat all the ſeven days: as alſo of the other ſolemn Sacrifices, which was lawfull for ſuch only as were clean, to be eaten. For Chriſt did not (as ſome would have it) prevent the uſe of the Paſchal Lamb one day, as doth plainly appear by <hi>Luke,</hi> who ſaith expreſly (<hi>chapter</hi> 22.) that the night wherein Chriſt did eat the Paſchal Lamb, it was neceſſary to kill and eat that Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lamb. But enough of this already.</p>
               <p>The Jews indeed did eat the moſt excellent Paſsover: not to themſelvs, but unto us. That true Lamb, which they by their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed act offered, is ſufficient for us. <hi>For this is the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> Joh. 1. and is our Paſsover, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore went out to thoſe Jews which refuſed to come in unto him, and that contrary to the cuſtom of other Governours, who were not wont to condeſcend ſo low to the people. And though he was a Gentile and an Heathen, and had only his reaſon, and the Laws of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to regulate his actions by, yet he carried himſelf more juſtly and civilly than the Jews who had the Scripture and Law of God, and were counted the people of God. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was a great civility in <hi>Pilate</hi> to conform himſelf to the cuſtom of the people, and give place to their obſtinacy. For when he ſaw that they abhorred the houſe of an Ethnick, he did not compel them by any tyrannical force to come into the Judgement Hall, contrary to the cuſtom they had received: but waving his own power, he went forth to them. A Superiour muſt not always ſtand ſtifly upon his prerogative, but ſometimes accommodate himſelf to the manners of his Subjects. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="248" facs="tcp:171778:159"/> 2. We read in <hi>Joſephus</hi> concerning <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he behaved himſelf as pliable to them, when the Statues of <hi>Caeſar</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be ſet-up in the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> for when he ſaw that the reſolution of the people was ſuch, that they would rather die than endure thoſe Statues there; he yielded to them, and removed the Statues out of the Temple, although he might have deſtroyed them all with that Army which was raiſed for that purpoſe, unleſs they would have ſubmitted. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhewed a great deal of Juſtice, in that he did not preſently condemn Chriſt before he heard him, as they deſired that brought him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. He did much diſappoint their expectation; for the Judge would do nothing raſhly, but would firſt ſift out the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the buſineſs. Therefore he ſaid, <hi>What accuſation bring ye againſt this man?</hi> No man is ſaid to be condemned, if he be not firſt accuſed, and have leave to anſwer for himſelf. This Ethnick here obſerved the equity of this Law: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the Jews cry out,
<hi>If he were not a Malefactor we would not have delivered him unto thee,</hi> q d. the evidence and clearneſs of the Fact committed needs no further accuſation. Do thou Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; there's no need of any more examination. Doſt thou queſtion our righteouſneſs? Doſt thou think we will not do Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice? Doſt not ſee who and what we are who have brought this man bound before thee? Is this all the reſpect thou giveſt to the Prieſts of the moſt High God? Doſt thou make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us and the common Rabble? Do not think that we would bring one before thee that were not guilty of death. Thou mayſt ſee how ſtrictly we keep the Law, for we will not ſo much as come into thy houſe, we dare not tred within thy doors. Nor think thou that we have done any thing in this matter, either out of envy or hatred, or too precipitate without deliberation and good advice. We have conſidered all things, and finde that he doth deſerve to die, thou haſt nothing to do but to pronounce Sentence; <hi>For if he were not a malefactor.</hi> &amp;c. O the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie! O the lyes and malice of theſe men! Should things be thus carryed? Is this to execute Juſtice? Is every priſoner a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor and guilty of death? Who ſees not that they diſtruſt the goodneſs of their Cauſe? Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They go about to blind and delude the Judge with vain and empty words, leſt they ſhould be put upon it to prove him a
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:171778:159"/> malefactor. Conſider well, O Chriſtian, the malice of theſe men. They would fain ſeem to be juſt and righteous, even againſt the check of their own conſcience; as if they had never attempted any ſuch thing, and never went about to deſtroy any but a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, when tis evident that they were the men that did moſt unjuſtly put all the Prophets to death.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In this alſo they ſhew their malice, in that they would have Chriſt cut off before he was examined or convicted: nay they think him not worthy that the Judge ſhould ſo much as give him audience, or that he ſhould be tryed according to any Rule of Law.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They openly charge him as a Malefactor before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Barr, and in the face of the open Court, who had healed all their ſick. Ask the Lepers whom he cleanſed, and the blind whoſe ſight he reſtored, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whether he were a Malefactor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But thus it is written, <hi>They rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love,</hi> Pſalm 35. Again, <hi>For my love they are my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, but I prayed for them,</hi> Pſalm 109 Chriſt did here truly pray even when he held his peace, conſidering with himſelf our ſins, for which he ſuffered all this wrong.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pilate</hi> being now incenſed and moved with ſome chollar at ſuch proud and unrighteous expreſſions, cryes out to them again: <hi>Take ye him, and judge him after your own Law:</hi> as if he had ſaid, if he be a Malefactor, as you ſay he is, but do not prove it, why then put your own Law in execution againſt him. The <hi>Roman</hi> Laws prohibit me to condemn any man before he hath a full hearing. Truly
<hi>Pilate,</hi> the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> did enjoyn the ſame too; but ſo it is by the malice of theſe men, that the Heathens Laws are now prefer'd before the Law of God. The <hi>Jews</hi> very well know it from
<hi>Exod.</hi> 23. and we alſo know the ſame from the words of
<hi>Nicodemus, that the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no man untill he be firſt heard and convinced,</hi> John 7. But ſee how they evade it: <hi>It is not lawfull for us,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to put any man to death.</hi> Well, but who then I pray, put <hi>Stephen</hi> to death? <hi>Act.</hi> 7. What Authority put him to death? Therefore they lye groſly. Was not this to put Chriſt to death, when they deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him up to be ſentenced to die, and laboured with all importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to have him put to death? But they would have him put to death by the laws of <hi>Rome,</hi> that ſo as well they as their laws might
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:171778:160"/> be acquitted from doing any ſuch thing. Their Law was to ſtone to death; but the <hi>Roman</hi> Law was to crucifie. This is that they would have. They would not barely have Chriſt put to death, but they would have it done with the greateſt reproach &amp; ſhame that might be. Nor did it ſo fall out by chance, or by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, but that the ſaying of Jeſus might be fulfilled, when he certainly foretold, that he ſhould be delivered to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and be crucified by them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. Chriſt alſo had ſaid, that the Son of man muſt be lifted up, as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent, <hi>John</hi> 3.12. Again, <hi>When I am lifted up, I will draw all unto me,</hi> Joh. 12. And again, <hi>When the ſon of man ſhall be lifted up, then ſhall ye know that I am he,</hi> John 8. Now when the <hi>Jews</hi> perceived that they ſhould miſs their aym, and that there was no good to be done with
<hi>Pilate,</hi> unleſs they brought ſome Accuſation and certain proof of clear crimes againſt Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>They began to accuſe him</hi> (<hi>of many things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 23.2.</note> Mar. 15.3.) <hi>ſaying, we found this fellow perverting our Nation, and forbidding to give Tribute to</hi> Caeſar, <hi>ſaying, that he himſelf is Chriſt a King. Then</hi> Pilate
<hi>entred into the Judgement Hall again, and called Jeſus, and ſaid unto him, Art thou the King of the</hi> Jews? (John 18.33.) <hi>Jeſus anſwered,</hi> (<hi>ſtanding before him,</hi> Mat. 27.11.) <hi>Sayeſt thou this thing of thy ſelf? or did others tell it thee of me?</hi> Pilate
<hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, am I a</hi> Jew? <hi>thine own Nation, and the chief Prieſts have delivered thee unto me, what haſt thou done? Jeſus anſwered, my Kingdom is not of this World: If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the</hi> Jews: <hi>but now is my Kingdom not from hence.</hi> Pilate <hi>therefore ſaid unto him, Art thou a King then? Jeſus anſwered thou ſayeſt that I am a King. To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the World, that I might bear witneſs unto the Truth: every one that is of the Truth heareth my voyce.</hi> Pilate <hi>ſaith unto him, what is Truth? And when he had ſaid this, he went out again unto the</hi> Jews, <hi>and ſaith unto them, I find in him no fault at all. And they were the more fierce, ſaying, he ſtirreth up the people, teaching throughout all</hi> Jury, <hi>beginning from</hi> Galilee <hi>to this place,</hi> Luke 23.5.</p>
               <p>This was Chriſts firſt examination in <hi>Pilates</hi> Court, where the <hi>Jews</hi> Accuſations are firſt laid down. Leſt thou ſhouldſt think, O <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſay they, that we have nothing to lay to this mans
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:171778:160"/> charge, hear, we pray thee, what juſt cauſe we have to hate and abhor him. He is a ſeducer of the Nation, the Author of all mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinies, he f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ribids men to pay Cuſtom and Tribute, he calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which is no leſs then high Treaſon againſt his Imperial Majeſty. And is not this crime and cauſe enough againſt him? What wouldſt thou have more? Every one of theſe Accuſations is ſufficient to condemn him. Here thou ſeeſt, O Chriſtian, how truly <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>The teeth of the children of men are ſpears and arrows, and their tongue a ſharp ſword,</hi> Pſal. 57. Thou ſeeſt alſo the perverſe mind of thoſe men. They think to be converted, is to pervert: they put good for evil, and evil for good. Laſtly, they lye moſt notoriouſly. They accuſe him for three things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He perverteth the Nation, ſay they, from the Law and Worſhip of God. This they were by no means able to prove. For Chriſt never led away, or call'd any man off from the Law and Worſhip of God: but rather put all men upon the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods Law and Service, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. where he ſaith, <hi>I came not to deſtroy the Law and the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore he doth there expound the Law unto them. To be turned from the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſaical Traditions, is not to be drawn off from God, or from Gods Word and Worſhip.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They object againſt Chriſt, that he forbad to pay Tribute to <hi>Caeſar.</hi> This was a manifeſt falſhood; for it is evident to all the world, that Chriſt commanded <hi>to give unto Caeſar the things that were Caeſars, Mat.</hi> 22. And not only ſo, but Chriſt himſelf paid the toll-mony, Mat. 17. Finally, he took care by the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul,</hi> that this very thing ſhould be given in charge to all Chriſtians, <hi>Ro.</hi> 13.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They charge him for ſaying he was the King Meſſias. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did theſe lying men hear Chriſt ſpeak any of all this. For he never ſpake ſo plainly of himſelf, although it was all very true: For he was, I ſay, and is the King Meſſias, and hath proved him ſelf to be ſo: for which he doth not ſo much deſerve to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as commended. How durſt thou then, O thou <hi>Jew,</hi> to cry out: He ſaid that he was the Meſſias? Why didſt not thou put this in alſo; that he was born after the ſame manner, nature, time, and place, as the Meſſias was to be born? And that he preached the Kingdom of God, and did work ſuch Miracles as never any elſe did; yea and thoſe very Miracles which the Prophets foretold of
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:171778:161"/> the Meſſias? But here their malice blinded them, that they could ſee nothing but what made againſt Chriſt. Theſe wicked men knew that <hi>Pilate</hi> would be netled and grow impatient to hear of Treaſon. Therefore they harp ſo much on this ſtring, and ſo often with envy inculcate the name of King. For his other Names, as Chriſt and Meſſias, <hi>Pilate</hi> did not ſo much regard.</p>
               <p>Chriſt was charged with theſe three things: as a Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Law of God, of the Law of man, and of the Law of nature.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As a Tranſgreſſor againſt the Law of God, as one that had taught falſe Doctrine, and did labour to draw men off from God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Againſt the Law of man, in that he moved ſedition.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Againſt the Law of nature, as one denying Tribute to the civil Magiſtrate. Theſe are the Accuſations which our conſcience muſt have been charged with all, and that juſtly too, before the Judgement ſeat of God. But Chriſt took them all upon him, that we might for ever be freed from them. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Be thou thankfull unto him, who was unjuſtly accuſed, and was contented ſo to be, to deliver thee from a juſt Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Learn thou alſo to bear the unjuſt ſlanders of men patient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For thou art not greater then thy Lord. And by all means do thou beware that thou accuſe not Chriſt by murmuring againſt God,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now when <hi>Pilate</hi> had heard the Accuſation, he went again into the Judgement Hall, wherein he did the duty of a juſt Judge. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Although the <hi>Jews</hi> flockt together in great multitudes, as if they would force the Judge to paſs ſentence, yet
<hi>Pilate</hi> was not daunted. And tis the Wiſe mans Counſell, that none ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire the place of a Judge, unleſs he hath a ſpirit and courage enough that dares controll wicked men, though never ſo potent, and not to fear the faces of any, ſo as to pervert Judgement for them, <hi>Eccl.
7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Although the <hi>Jews</hi> laid many and grievous things to the charge of Chriſt, yet he did not ſuddenly give credit to them, notwithſtanding they were men of great power and Authority: but doth firſt examine the cauſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He doth ask Chriſt privately by himſelf, and queſtion him
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:171778:161"/> alone, leſt Chriſt ſhould be baffled by his potent Adverſaries, and not ſuffered to anſwer for himſelf.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He doth not threaten or rayl at him, but ſpeaks him fair, and gives him very good language. It becomes a Judge to be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and courteous. For he alſo muſt come before his Judge, <hi>Wiſd. 7.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly, Of all the Accuſations which the
<hi>Jews</hi> brought in againſt him, he takes notice but of one, the reſt he paſt over in ſilence. Theſe are the Properties of a good Judge. There was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wanting in <hi>Pilate,</hi> but Faith and the fear of God: which whoſoever hath not, he will not long continue juſt and honeſt, as we ſhall ſee anon in <hi>Pilate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is that about which <hi>Pilate</hi> did examine Chriſt? <hi>Art thou,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the King of the</hi> Jews? This was the crime which he enquired after, becauſe it concern'd
<hi>Caeſars</hi> Majeſty, and the publique peace, and was that which might have ſome probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in it. For about Chriſts time there were many mutinies and ſeditions among the <hi>Jews</hi> raiſed by <hi>Judas</hi> of
<hi>Galilee,</hi> and by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Prophet; alſo by one
<hi>Theudas,</hi> and <hi>Caphedon,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> reporteth. It was probable Chriſt might be of the ſame gang with thoſe ſeditious perſons, inaſmuch as he taught ſome new things never heard of before, and the common ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were wonderfully taken with him. Now thoſe ſeditions did ſpring from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe the ſeventy weeks ſpoken of in <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. were now almoſt expired, and the Meſſias was earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked for every moment, to reſtore the people to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer freedom, and deliver them from the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke. Many therefore arrogating to themſelves the honour of the Meſſias, and promiſing the people liberty, became thereby the Ring-lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of ſuch as revolted from the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. And moſt of the people did conjecture that Jeſus was that long expected Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias. For if he had not made an eſcape, they had choſen him King, <hi>John</hi> 6. <hi>Pilate</hi> therefore underſtanding nothing of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Kingdom of the Meſſias, and minding only a carnal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Empire, could not but take notice of the Title King, which was faſtned on him, not ſo much out of fear for
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> as himſelf. Therefore demanded whether he were King of the
<hi>Jews?</hi> For the Wiſe men had called him King of the <hi>Jews, Mat.</hi> 2. And the people called him King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> John 12. And truly ſo he
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:171778:162"/> was King of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and of
<hi>Iſrael</hi> too: but not in <hi>Pilates</hi> ſenſe. But why do I ſay King of the <hi>Iews?</hi> Chriſt was and is King of all Kings, yea and of all people in the World, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 47.</p>
               <p>Now as in the firſt place, the Worlds great complaint againſt Chriſt is, that he will not hold his peace and let the World alone and be quiet, as we heard before in the houſe of <hi>Annas:</hi> ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it doth as much complain of Chriſt that he will and muſt Raign. The world is in bodily fear of loſing its Kingdom. Thus <hi>Herod</hi> was exceeding afraid when Chriſt was born, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2. So here, the
<hi>Roman</hi> power is caſt into a quaking fit, leſt it ſhould be deſtroyed by Chriſt. And thus Worldlings are ſtill afraid that Chriſt will take away their Riches and Honours from them. But there is no ground why theſe ſilly men ſhould ſo fear it. He that can give Heavenly Kingdoms, will ſcorn thoſe that are mortal. He came not to take our earthly things from us, but to give us Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things with them. Chriſt doth not deny us things terrene, but teacheth us to make good uſe of them.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Pilates</hi> Queſtion Chriſt makes his anſwer ſo, that he doth neither deny himſelf to be a King, nor directly affirm it: and this he did moſt wiſely. For if he had preſently anſwered and ſaid,
<hi>I am a King,</hi> before he had diſtinguiſhed his Kingdom from the kingdoms of men, he had given <hi>Pilate</hi> occaſion to revile him. What then doth he reply? <hi>Speakeſt thou this of thy ſelf, or did others tell it thee of me?</hi> Which may be taken,</p>
               <p n="1">1. By way of Admiration, <hi>q.d.</hi> O <hi>Pilate,</hi> what a great thing, and how certain a Truth doſt thou ſpeak, of which thou art alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ignorant and unwitting? Whence hadſt thou it that thou ſhouldſt call me a King, whereas none can ſay that this Jeſus is, (that is, that I am) the Lord, but by the Holy Ghoſt? Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, whenceſoever thou hadſt it, whether of thy ſelf, or from others, thou haſt truly ſpoken a mighty matter, if ſo be thou didſt but underſtand thine own words, and know what thou ſayeſt. In like manner Chriſt admired that noble anſwer of the Centurian, who ſaid, <hi>Lord, I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may be taken as a reprehenſion of <hi>Pilate,</hi> as if Chriſt had ſaid: If thou wouldſt faſten this upon me from thine own jealouſie, then thou doſt not the part of a juſt Judge. For a Judge muſt not judge according to his own private ſurmiſes, but as the
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:171778:162"/> ceſe is. But if others have told thee theſe Tales of me, they muſt prove what they ſay, let them make it appear that I went about to raiſe a Rebellion. But,</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt did thus anſwer, eſpecially to give an occaſion to ſpeak what follows. <hi>Am I a</hi> Jew? ſaith he,
<hi>q.d.</hi> How ſhould I ſay this of mine own head, when I am no Jew, but a <hi>Gentile?</hi> What do we that are Heathens know of your affairs? Thine own Nation and the High Prieſts have delivered thee unto me, and have accuſed thee under this Notion before me. They have thus aſperſed thee: I neither apprehended, nor accuſed thee. What is it which thou haſt done? let me hear it from thine own mouth, do thou tell me thy ſelf, what haſt thou done to cauſe ſo many and ſo great men, yea thine own Prelates and Clergy, and all the whole Nation to hate thee?</p>
               <p>Chriſt made no anſwer to this. For he had done nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their ſpite and ſpleen. But all that he did was rather wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of commendation: for he did all things well, he did all good things, and nothing but good; and all good things were created by him. But he did anſwer to the former queſtion, and diſtinguiſh his Kingdom from the kingdom of the World, to ſhew that he had nothing offended againſt <hi>Caeſar; My Kingdom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is not of this World,</hi> q.d. <hi>Pilate,</hi> I acknowledge and confeſs that I am a King, and this is all that I have done. This is the crime that I am accuſed of. But underſtand it aright: Tis true, I am a King, yet ſo, as that I neither uſurp or diminiſh the power of thy
<hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> or intend to pull down the Power or Dominion of any King or Prince: And that thou mayeſt fully know my meaning,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I am not a worldly, but an Heavenly King, in whoſe hand are the hearts of all Kings, though thou doſt little ſee it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. My Kingdom, that it is, my Principality and Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or my Kingdom, that is, my Laws and Statutes; or my kingdom, that is, my officers and ſubjects, this my kingdom is not of this world, that is, it is not of men, but of God. <hi>I am,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>made a King by him upon his holy Hill of Sion,</hi> Pſalm 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is not of this World, that is, it is not a Temporal, but a Spiritual Kingdom. For the World and the deſire thereof paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is not of this world, that is, it doth not conſiſt in the things of this world: as in Riches, Pleaſures, Pomp, (for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:171778:163"/> is of this world, <hi>is the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life)</hi> but in Spiritual things, as <hi>Righteouſneſs, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom.
14.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It is not of this world, becauſe it hath other Rights and Laws which a worldly Kingdom hath not.</p>
               <p n="6">6. It is not of this world, becauſe it is not corporal, but Spiritual.</p>
               <p n="7">7. It is governed after another manner than the Kingdoms of this world. For theſe are Ruled by a material Sword, but my Kingdom hath no need of ſuch a Sword. The Sword of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the Word of God. The Kingdoms of the world have Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Towers, Towns, Villages, Hoſts, Armies, Ammunition: but my Kingdom doth require nothing but the hearts of men. The world doth rule over mens eſtates and perſons, but my Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſwayeth only their hearts and conſciences. The world vaunts it with carnal power, but muſt ſtoop to that which is Spiritual. I care nothing at all for fleſhly ſtrength, but I Triumph and Raign ſpiritually over ſin, death, and hell. See how lively Chriſt ſets forth his Kingdom. In the ſame manner almoſt doth <hi>Zachary</hi> ſpeak of Chriſts Kingdom: <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thy King cometh unto thee meek and lowly,</hi> Zach. 9.</p>
               <p>Note alſo that he doth not ſay, my Kingdom is not in this world. For he is Lord of the world too. All things were made by Chriſt, and by him are they all governed and diſpoſed. <hi>All power is given unto him in Heaven and in earth,</hi> Mat. 28. Now if the Kingdom of Chriſt be not of this world, then it will follow that there is another world beſides this. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If thou doſt not ſee the Promiſes of Chriſt fulfill'd in this world, yet do not deſpair; for there is another world, wherein ſhall be made good whatſoever was not performed here.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas the Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are commanded to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then Chriſt doth here free <hi>Pilate</hi> from all his fear. And by his Example alſo he doth prove that he did not at all affect the
<hi>Caeſarean</hi> or regall power. <hi>If my Kingdom were of this world,</hi> ſaith he,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I would not march with naked Diſciples, but would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide me armed men: yea, I would have my Counſell of War, Souldiers, an Army, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who ſhould guard me as their Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall with their Swords in this my neceſſity, and would hazard their lives for me. Or,</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:171778:163"/> 2. If I ſought a worldly Kingdom, the Angels themſelves would defend me from the violence of the <hi>Jews.</hi> But I have no need of the help of Angels or men. My own right hand is able to ſupply me with ayd ſufficient. Here the weakneſs of a world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Kingdom is ſeen, which hath no ſtrength of it ſelf, but all from its Subjects and Officers: and if theſe fail, a King is but in an ill caſe. But if they do liſt themſelves under him, they may prove falſe and betray him many wayes. But the Kingdom that is from above is ſufficient of it ſelf, and needs not the help of any. From all this Chriſt concludeth that his Kingdom is not from hence, as if he had ſaid, Thou mayſt certainly aſſure thy ſelf by this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that my Kingdom is not worldly or earthy. What ever thou, or thy <hi>Caeſar</hi> hath ſhall be in no danger for me: I covet nothing of yours. I care not for all the glory and riches of the world, which you ſo highly eſteem. Theſe things were ſpoken to <hi>Pilate,</hi> but they do as much concern us.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For if Chriſts Kingdom be not from hence, Why then, O Chriſtian, doſt thou ſeek after the Riches and Honours of this world?</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Kingdom of Chriſt be not of this world, then Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians muſt expect to ſuffer in the world, ſo long as they have the peace of their conſciences in Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 16. Wonder not then that the godly meet with ſo much trouble in the world. A good man in all his afflictions ſhould comfort himſelf with this word, ſaying, <hi>My Kingdom is not from hence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. If Chriſts Kingdom be not from hence, they are much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken then who place the Kingdom of Chriſt in outward things, and the Elements of the world. <hi>The Kingdom of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is within you,</hi> Luke 17. Which is not ſo to be underſtood, as if this lower world were not created by God, or did not belong unto God, as having nothing to do with it; as <hi>Manichaeus</hi> was of opinion. For it is certain that all the ends of the earth are his, the ſea is his, and he made it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pſalm 95.</p>
               <p>But however Chriſt put a clear difference between his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the kingdom of the world; yet the name of King did ſtick in
<hi>Pilates</hi> ſtomack. For he was never wont to hear in all the dubblings of honour amongſt their Princes, that ever any did uſurp the Royal Title. And he conceived that this Title ought not to be given to any without
<hi>Caeſars</hi> conſent and approbation.

                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:171778:165"/> Therefore he ſaith, <hi>Art thou then a King?</hi> notwithſtanding thy Kingdom be not of this world. He ſtickles much at the Title King, this he could not bear. For he ſaw it would follow, that if his Kingdom were not from hence, it muſt be from ſomewhere elſe. Let the Kingdom be whence it will, a Kingdom it was and would be. Wherefore by way of concluſion he infers upon him, <hi>Art thou therefore a King?</hi> The queſtion had been better put thus: where is then thy Kingdom? Where is that other world thou talkſt of? He might perhaps have had an anſwer to this queſtion that might have done him ſome good. But he asked not after any of theſe things, he was afraid of his own kingdom and office.</p>
               <p>Chriſt therefore doth undauntedly anſwer him, <hi>Thou ſayſt that I am a King:</hi> as if he had ſaid, what need I tell thee, when thou thy ſelf ſayeſt it? Is it not enough that thou ſayeſt it thy ſelf? which is all one, as if he had plainly ſaid, I am, I grant that I am a King. Chriſt doth Emphatically repeat the name <hi>King,</hi> to ſhew us that he did not repent him, nor was he aſhamed of his Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtial and Spiritnal Kingdom, but had rather that by all means it ſhould be known to
<hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf, as well as to all men. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the ſalvation of us all doth depend on this Kingdom, it ought not to be denyed or concealed. And it is a ſweet &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable word for Chriſt to ſay that he is a King. He is truly a King, as it is ſaid, <hi>I have ſet my King,</hi> &amp;c. Pſalm 2. Again, <hi>Thou madeſt him to have Dominion over the works of thy hands,</hi> Pſalm 8. Wherefore if thou ſinneſt, do not preſently deſpair: for thou art not without the Kingdom of Chriſt, till thou ceaſeſt to be the work of God. Hence ſaith the Wiſe man:
<hi>Though we ſin, we are thine,</hi> Wiſd. 15. He will acknowledge thee for his poſſeſſion, if thou wilt acknowledge him to be thy Lord. But that <hi>Pilate</hi> might not further be offended at the Title of King, Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth to explain his Kingdom yet more fully; as if he had ſaid, <hi>Pilate,</hi> underſtand this buſineſs well, and lay aſide all ſuſpition of a worldly Kingdom and Tyranny. Thus ſtands the caſe: I will not deny that my Kingdom is altogether and wholly Spiritual, whether before thee, or before <hi>Caeſar</hi> himſelf. Only know this, that tis not my purpoſe to moleſt any with Arms, or to Raign in State like other Kings, but only to raiſe up and eſtabliſh the truth of God upon earth.
<hi>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:171778:165"/> came I into the world, that I might bear witneſs unto the Truth.</hi> I ſay, I came for that end, and was born for that cauſe, and not to fight with the Sword, but that I might teach and preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and the Truth of God, which <hi>is his power to ſalvation to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 1. And as I publiſh the Goſpel, ſo I rule by the Goſpel in the hearts of Believers, over Sin, Death, and the Devil: that for ſin I might beſtow Righteouſneſs, for Death Life, for the Croſs Joy, and Heaven inſtead of Hell: Theſe are the Tenures or cuſtomary Holds and Priviledges of my Kingdom, of which none can be partaker, but he that heareth my Voyce, and believeth with his heart. I do not endow my followers with Riches, Cities, and other Fee farms, Manours,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> but through my Word I beſtow upon them Joy, Peace, Life, and Heaven it ſelf. My Goſpel is the Scepter of my Kingdom. And what prejudice are theſe to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperour? Would <hi>Caeſar</hi> have none born, would he have no man come into the world that ſhould bear witneſs unto the Truth? Would it be any ſtain to his honour, if any of his Souldiers ſhould hear his voyce that is a witneſs of the Truth? Who would not utterly deteſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor him that ſhould harbour ſuch a thought in his breaſt? The very Name of Truth is am able: yea the Nature of man it ſelf agreeth to this, that the Name of Truth is moſt honourable: and though arrant knaves hate the thing, yet never any had the face to diſlike or find rault with the Name of Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>And truly Chriſt teſtified the Truth with a witneſs. For the Teſtimony of Truth is the confuſion of falſhood. The world was miſtaken in the uſe of Temporal things. For thoſe things which were given only to be uſed, in theſe the world place their love and confidence. Chriſt by reproving this falſity, bare witneſs to the Truth.
<note place="margin">2.</note>The <hi>Jews</hi> erred in a wrong underſtanding of the Law. The <hi>Gentiles</hi> were deceived by their Idolatry.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Chriſt in reprehending &amp; bearing down both their errors, did bear witneſs to the Truth. Well then might he ſay, that therefore he came, &amp; to that end was he born. For this cauſe, ſaith he, I became man: for this purpoſe am I now here, that errour &amp; iniquity may be deſtroyed, &amp; that truth and righteouſneſs may raign. This I do, and this I will do; it is, and ever ſhall be my buſineſs to beat down, keep under, and cruſh the Devil, that God alone may be exalted and Raign. If thou therefore art a child of Truth, if thou doſt love the Truth,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:171778:166"/> if thou deſireſt nothing but the Truth, thou wilt hear my Voyce with joy and gladneſs. For I am Truth it ſelf, and can ſpeak and teach nothing but the Truth. Which thing we that are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and are of the Truth, do not only believe it, but are alſo the thing it ſelf. The Voyce of Chriſt is Truth, which abideth for ever, yea though <hi>Moſes, Jupiter, Mahomet, Hereticks</hi> and
<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> die, nay <hi>Tyberius</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> too, yet this liveth for ever. Therefore every one that is of the Truth heareth my Voyce. Hereby teaching us who they be that belong to his Kingdom; He doth not ſay, every one that truly is, or hath truly a being, for the Devil and wicked men have truly a being: but he ſaith, he that is of the Truth. A lye is that which is not, or is not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: <hi>Adam</hi> is not, the World is not. He then that is of <hi>Adam,</hi> of man, or of the World, is of a lye. He is of the truth that loveth the conſtant truth, that ſeeketh the everlaſting Good, that thirſteth after Righteouſneſs and eternal Life: This is he that heareth my Voyce, this is he that belongeth to my Kingdom, and one that ſubjecteth himſelf to my Government. Chriſt therefore is no Lord and King to thoſe who covet Riches, aſpire to the Honours of this world, and hunt after pleaſures. Nor is he their King who are mutinous and raiſe ſeditions: but he is their King who thirſt for Righteouſneſs, earneſtly breath after the Celeſtial Joy, and willingly hear and obey the Truth. From all which it is plain and evident that Chriſt had not at all offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When Chriſt had given ſo high a commendation of the truth,
<hi>Pilate</hi> being ſomewhat moved and taken therewith, and as an Ethnick to whom ſuch things were ſomewhat uncouth, he asked Jeſus <hi>what was Truth?</hi> An excellent queſtion indeed, if it had proceeded from his heart, and that he had been in earneſt. For what is more profitable and pleaſant to ſearch after, then the truth? All the world invocateth the truth, as we read, 1 <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras</hi> 4. Yea wicked men themſelves, though they be lyars and falſe, yet will preſs others to ſpeak the truth, and would not be cheated and deceived: Much more beautifull is truth in ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all things. But <hi>Pilate</hi> did not ask this queſtion heartily, but as it were ſcornfully and diſdainfully, as if he had ſaid, Doſt thou broach any other truth then what your High Prieſts and our Prieſts teach? Thou haſt ſaid enough and more then enough,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:171778:166"/> theres no need of any more at this time. I came not hither to hear a Sermon. There are other matters in hand. We have more Irons in the fire. Wicked men loath nothing more then the Word of God, and thoſe things that tend to their good and ſalvation: here they ſtand upon thorns, and think long ere they be at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhould have been warmed and encouraged by Chriſts Word. But he was no more moved then if he had offered Gold or moſt Orient Pearls to a blind man, he was as blind as a beetle, the Sun was darkneſs to him. He whoſe underſtanding is dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened cannot diſcern the ſplendor of Truth which darts the rays of its luſtre into the minds of the godly. <hi>Pilate</hi> indeed was not worthy to hear an anſwer to his queſtion. He heard enough if he would have believed it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But Chriſt would no longer linger out his Paſſion. And what need was there to enquire what was truth? Lo Chriſt that ſtood there preſent, was and is the Truth. Whatever Idolatrous Prieſts trifle about Vertue: or the Jewiſh High Prieſts teach concerning fleſhly righteouſneſs, they are all but lyes: nothing but Chriſt, and the Goſpel only is Truth, and what follows and is drawn by conſequence from the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pilate</hi> having not received an anſwer to his mind, went out to the <hi>Jews</hi> again. He ſuppoſed that the Laws of
<hi>Caeſar</hi> would have ſerved his turn, and that he needed no other know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth. Secondly, He perceived that this did not much concern the caſe in hand. Thirdly, He ſaw the <hi>Jews</hi> were in haſte, and twas no time to talk any longer with Chriſt. For the <hi>Jews</hi> were afraid leſt Chriſt ſhould mollifie the mind of the Judge with his words, which they knew were very efficacious and penetrating. Laſtly, He had now learned by experience that there was nothing in Chriſt whereby he might defend himſelf if he were put to death, and complaint thereof ſhould be made to <hi>Caeſar</hi> againſt him for his unjuſt puniſhment: for the Prince of all juſt men, and the King of Righteouſneſs had put on Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs for a Breſt-plate, and true Judgement for an Helmet, and equity for an invincible B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>kler, that no man could by any means catch him in his words. Therefore he who firſt went forth that he might hear ſome Accuſation againſt him, doth now go out to excuſe Jeſus before his Accuſers. <hi>I find,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>no fault in this
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:171778:167"/> man.</hi> Here we find again a civil Righteouſneſs in <hi>Pilate.</hi> For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Although there were rich and potent men on one hand, from whom he might hope for gain, or fear ſome loſs; but Chriſt was all alone, a poor man, quite caſt off by all his friends, from whom he ſaw no ground to expect any advantage, or fear any detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: yet he takes Chriſts part againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> which is the duty of a Righteous judge, though ſuch be rare to be found. Whence it is that the Princes of the
<hi>Jews</hi> are ſo often reproved for not judging the cauſe of the Fatherleſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. Therefore <hi>Moſes</hi> would have ſuch Judges that hated covetouſneſs, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. For bribes will make men blind. Hence it is that Judges are ſo often call'd upon to fear the Lord:
<hi>Be inſtructed ye that judge the earth, ſerve the Lord in fear,</hi> Pſalm 2.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Pilate</hi> doth not only take his part and ſtand for Chriſt, but he doth clearly confound his Adverſaries, by proclaiming him guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and that after he had throughly examined the whole buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, although they had bound him as a Felon, and one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to die.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He doth plainly prove them lyers to their face, if they would but have taken notice of it, and could have bluſht for ſhame at it. But they were of thoſe to whom it was ſaid, <hi>Thy neck is iron, and thy forehead braſs, thou refuſeſt to be aſhamed;</hi> Iſa. 48. Let Judges here learn, not only to favour a good cauſe, but to confound thoſe who go about to promote a baſe buſineſs, ſo as that they dare not to do or preſume upon the like before him for ever after.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is much to be noted, that he doth not only abſolve Chriſt from the crime which they accuſed him of; but he ſpeaks in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, <hi>I find no fault in him.</hi> And this may be moſt truly ſaid of Chriſt: <hi>For he did no ſin, nor was there any guile found in his mouth,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There is an Emphaſis in what he ſaith; <hi>I find no fault in This man.</hi> For Chriſt only is free from any ſtain or ſpot of ſin: but no other man is clear from crimes. Therefore it is a very great and full Teſtimony of Chriſts innocency, that the ſame Judge who afterward crucified him, not once, but often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed this Jeſus innocent in the open Court: which alone is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for us againſt the calumnies and ſlanders of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans.</hi> Let him therefore that is yet incredulous here, ſee whether
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:171778:167"/> Chriſt did not ſuffer wrongfully or no. This defence then of Chriſt is diligently to be conſidered. It is alſo to be well obſerved, that Chriſt was accuſed of his own people, but excuſed by ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. And ſo it was to follow, that the
<hi>Jews</hi> ſhould blaſpheme him, but the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould with great deſire receive and glorifie Chriſt. Thus is it even at this day, that the Goſpel is of no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute among his people the <hi>Jews,</hi> but is had in high eſteem by ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>But what do the <hi>Jews,</hi> now they hear that
<hi>Pilate</hi> had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Jeſus, but excuſed and highly applauded? Their firſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſhattered to pieces. Reaſon, and conſcience, and plain experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was wholly againſt them, nor could they well tell what to do more. But ſhame and rage will break thorow all, and bear down all before it. Their ſhame made them ſlink away convicted from the place of Judgement. But their rage would not ſuffer them to reſt quiet. But as mad and frantick men uſe to do, what is wanting in reaſon, they make up in clamours and revilings. <hi>He ſtirreth up the people,</hi> ſay they, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Where not, that here they wholly omit that Accuſation which they thought would be of moſt force againſt him, &amp; run off to other things, ſo did their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice toyl &amp; torment them, as they were worthy and well deſerved that it ſhould. And that this ſecond Accuſation might carry the more credit, they tell where Chriſt began his Doctrine, to wit, in
<hi>Galilee,</hi> and had ſpread it as far as <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> it ſelf. What they object as an hainous crime, that we take for a great honour to Chriſt. And we bleſs God, and give him thanks, that his Word ran forth ſo far and wide in <hi>Syria</hi> before Chriſt was glorified: how much more ſhould we now do ſo ſince the glorifying of Chriſt? Chriſt firſt began his Goſpel in <hi>Galilee, viz.</hi> In <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum, Cana, Nazareth,</hi> &amp;c. this is certainly true. And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is as true, that his Doctrine ſpread as far as <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> But thirdly, whereas they ſpeak of ſtirring up the people, that was a lye. For Chriſt was not mutinous, but meek: not quarrelſome, but quiet, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſied of him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. The Doctrine of Chriſt brings peace, love and unity. Chriſts Doctrine doth not plunder any man of what is his own, nor incenſe one man againſt another. Nay it lets any Infidel alone as he, in reſpect of offering him any force or violence, or exerciſing any coercive power over his conſcience, yet is it not given to unbelievers, but to believers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:171778:168"/> It was not for nothing that they made mention of <hi>Galilee</hi> in that Accuſation of theirs; for thereby they thought to ſtir up the greater hatred in <hi>Pilate</hi> againſt Chriſt, becauſe there was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Galilean, Iudas</hi> by name, who went about to make a muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and an uproar among the people. Him they ſlily inſinuate unto <hi>Pilate,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, Thou muſt look to thy ſelf,
<hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> and take good heed of theſe <hi>Galileans</hi> which have ever been ſeditious, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mark here, they let ſlip nothing whereby they might any way aggravate their Accuſation againſt Chriſt. Such enemies Chriſt had, and the holy Apoſtles and Martyrs after him: that we might not think it much when we ſee like plots and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of wicked men contrived againſt us. To proceed:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> Pilate <hi>heard of</hi> Galilee,
<note place="margin">Luke 23.6.</note> 
                  <hi>he asked whether the man were a</hi> Galilean? <hi>And aſſoon as he knew that he belonged unto</hi> Herods <hi>ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, he ſent him to</hi> Herod, <hi>who himſelf alſo was at</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem <hi>at that time. And when</hi> Herod <hi>ſaw Jeſus, he was exceeding glad, for he was deſirous to ſee him of a long ſeaſon, becauſe he had heard many things of him, and he hoped to have ſeen ſome Miracle done by him. Then he queſtioned with him in many words, but he anſwered him nothing. And the chief Prieſts and Scribes ſtood, and vehemently accuſed him. And</hi> Herod <hi>with his men of War ſet him at naught, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous Robe, and ſent him again to</hi> Pilate. <hi>And the ſame day</hi> He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod <hi>and</hi> Pilate
<hi>were made friends together, for before they were at enmity between themſelves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate</hi> was glad when he heard them ſpeak of
<hi>Galilee,</hi> and not without cauſe: for he was willing to ſhift his hands of this bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glement, and to ſlip his neck out of the collar, he ſaw there was danger in it: for either he muſt condemn the innocent, or elſe he moſt incur the fierce diſpleaſure of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt him, fain he would have done neither. That therefore he might wind himſelf out of this mizmaze; he ſent him to <hi>Herod,</hi> which he might law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully do, for
<hi>Tyberius Caeſar</hi> had made <hi>Herod</hi> Tetrarch of
<hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> ſo that all that Country, and whatever belonged to it was under his juriſdiction, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. Now Chriſt according to his Humanity was of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> which is a Village or Town of
<hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee.</hi> There his holy Mother lived. And <hi>Pilate</hi> had rather expoſe his enemy then himſelf to ſo dangerous a buſineſs. But by the way take notice, that there are three <hi>Herods</hi> ſpoken of in the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:171778:168"/> Goſpel. The firſt was ſurnamed
<hi>Aſcalonita,</hi> the beaſtly ſpawn of which the other two were bred: this is he that ſlew the Children of <hi>Bethlem, Mat.</hi> 2. The ſecond was called <hi>Antipas,</hi> this is he that is here meant, and this is he that beheaded <hi>John Baptiſt, Mat.</hi> 14. The third was called <hi>Agrippa, He ſlew James the brother of John with the ſword,</hi> Act. 12. The middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt between the two <hi>Herods,</hi> was he of whom we now ſpeak. He was at this time at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe of the Paſsover: For otherwiſe he had nothing to do there; all buſineſs there was in
<hi>Pilates</hi> Juriſdiction. Thus then we follow our impriſoned, but moſt innocent Jeſus, from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> that is, from a wicked Heathen to an ungodly mungril <hi>Jew. For ſo it muſt be, when ye ſhall ſtand,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>before Kings and Governors,</hi> that is, before <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo it befell the Apoſtles not long after. And whereas Chriſt was toſt up and down, ſometimes to <hi>Annas,</hi> and ſometimes to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> now to
<hi>Pilate,</hi> and then to <hi>Herod,</hi> this was done by the divine Counſel of God, that every where he might have the greater teſtimony of his innocency. As it befell Chriſt to be dragged hither and thither, from Judge to Judge; the ſame doth ſtill befall the poor in the Courts of men, where they are always ſent from one Judge to another, till they periſh, and are utterly undone, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. Thus the poor is every where trampled upon, that he may be crucified with Jeſus. But for all this we ſhould not become impatient; for the world hath no better uſage for them, of which Chriſt himſelf had ſufficient experience. All theſe things are for our tryal, and that every Creature might be a witneſs of our tryal and patience.</p>
               <p>But to return again to <hi>Herod.</hi> When he ſaw Jeſus brought before him, he was exceeding glad, but this his joy was not good, for he did not rejoyce in the verity, but in vanity. He regarded not Chriſts Doctrine, or his own amendment, but he look'd only for ſome new and ſtrange thing, becauſe he had heard ſo much of Chriſt, and of his Miracles, he was in hope that Chriſt would work ſome wonder in his ſight to ſatisfie his curioſity. Others deſired ſigns to ſtrengthen their faith, but this man for his curioſity only. He had of a long time deſired to ſee Chriſt, but he would never vouchſafe to hear him preach, nor never ſo much as invited Chriſt to his houſe, ſo that you
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:171778:169"/> may ſee there was no goodneſs in the man at all; juſt as it is at this very day, the major part of our Grandees care little for Chriſt or his Doctrine. God doth know, and in his time he will make all know what it is that every one doth ſeek for in Chriſt. Sure
<hi>Herod</hi> was a Type of ſuch who read and hear the the Scriptures only out of curioſity, having no cordial reſpect at all to godlineſs.
<hi>Herod</hi> queſtioned Chriſt in many words, but he was not thought worthy to receive any anſwer, much leſs to ſee the leaſt ſign or miracle done before him. For why ſhould Chriſt caſt his pearls to ſuch ſwine? <hi>Herods</hi> cruelty did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to hear the things of God, and the Lord ſleighted his vaunting carriage. Chriſt doth not uſe to ſpeak, but when the conſcience of the hearer is in a capacity to hear.
<hi>For he doth not ſpeak after the hearing of his ears, nor judge after the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearance, Iſa.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Herod</hi> was one that did not ſeek after any true and ſolid matter, as <hi>Pilate</hi> did, he ſought for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but vanity. Therefore Chriſt anſwered <hi>Pilate,</hi> but he would not anſwer <hi>Herod;</hi> for it was ſhortly to be, that the truth ſhould be more clearly manifeſted and revealed to the Gentiles than to the Jews, becauſe they were more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and fitter for it than the
<hi>Jews</hi> were. And as <hi>Pilate</hi> was more ready to hear the truth than <hi>Herod,</hi> ſo the Gentiles did ſooner and more readily imbrace the Goſpel than the <hi>Jews.</hi> Where Chriſt finds never ſo ſmall a deſire to ſearch out the truth, there he is ready to reveal all myſteries. <hi>Pilate</hi> ſought but ſparingly, yet ſincerely after the Truth, therefore he was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy to hear more. But <hi>Herod</hi> ſought not the truth at all; therefore Chriſt ſpeaks not ſo much as one word in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, which he would never have done, had he been asked to another end, <hi>viz.</hi> to prove and make good his Doctrine, as he did before <hi>Annas,</hi> or to declare and reveal the Truth, as before
<hi>Pilate.</hi> To be ſhort, When Chriſt held his peace, he was pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient as a Lamb to be offered for the whole flock; but when he anſwered, he was as a good Shepherd that withſtood the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, and brake the ſnares and gins of thieves and wolves to preſerve the ſheep committed to his charge. Learn we hence,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That we give not that which is holy unto dogs, nor lay open divine Myſteries to thoſe who will ſcorn and ſcoff at them.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="267" facs="tcp:171778:169"/> 2. Let us not brag and boaſt of our vertues and graces, and of Gods gifts and our good works, to flouriſh it out before vain men, as Chriſt here would not put forth his Power. For they that affect the praiſe of men, they get nothing, but loſe and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the fruit of all their pains in themſelves. We cannot at one and the ſame time hunt after the favour and applauſe of the world, and thereby attain the Reward of coeleſtial Glory. Hence Chriſt ſaith of ſuch as vapour out their good works with a Trumpet, <hi>That they have all their reward already.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But though Chriſt ſaid nothing, the <hi>Jews</hi> did not hold their peace; They ſtood, and accuſed him vehmently. They had no other crime to produce againſt Chriſt, than what they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy charged him with before <hi>Pilate,</hi> yet they aggravate the ſame by their brawling clamours, hoping that <hi>Herod</hi> would ſooner ſatisfie their deſire then <hi>Pilate</hi> did. Beſides, the longer the buſineſs was delayed and put off, the more they were afraid that their cauſe would cool, and at laſt be quite caſhier'd the Court. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they preſs it on might and main. They thought <hi>Pilate</hi> was a little too remiſs in this buſineſs. They conceited of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they were ſuch men that nothing muſt be denyed them, were it never ſo baſe and diſhoneſt. But
<hi>Herod</hi> alſo by reaſon of his inbred pride and levity, doth not do any thing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and to the purpoſe, but only gives him a flout, and jeers at him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> eſpecially for the title and name of <hi>King,</hi> of which <hi>Herod</hi> thought none ſo worthy as himſelf. <hi>Herod</hi> therefore doth no more but diſdain and ſcornfully ſet him at nought: For with ſuch kind of men a Jugler, or Stageplayer is more taking and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable than a Preacher. He with his army ſet him at nought. <hi>A wicked King hath none but ungodly officers.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pro. 29.</note> He diſdain'd him as one that could ſhew no tricks, and as not able to do any feats; he ſcorn'd him as a ſilly fellow that could not tell how to anſwer a word: he lookt on him as a fool that knew not how to defend himſelf againſt his Accuſers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Thus the Power and Wiſdom of God is deſpiſed,</hi> (1 Cor. 1.) <hi>that the loftineſs of man might be abaſed and laid low.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Col. 2.</note> Chriſt in whom are hid all the treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, is forced to be <hi>Herods</hi> fool; and becauſe he did not do as he would have had him, therefore he ſlights and ſcoffs him as one that knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and as if he had been a meer Idiot. This <hi>Herodian</hi> ſcorn
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:171778:170"/> is very comfortable to all, eſpecially to ſuch as live among ſecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and factious people; for ſuch do truly live among Lions and Scorpions. But a man had need of great patience to ſtand it out againſt ſuch Scoffers and Scorners, in as much as a ſcoff and a jeer will many times trouble a wiſe man more than a cuff on the ear, or a blow with a Cudgel.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They did not only mock Chriſt with words, but withall they put him on a gay and gaudy ſuit, to make a laughing-ſtock of him. This cloaths was trim'd after ſuch a faſhion, that all that ſaw him might flock about him, and that whereſoever they led Chriſt they might ask,
<hi>What fool is that?</hi> 'Tis a ſign of infinite contempt and ſcorn, to make ſuch a mocking ſtock of any man. Here then, O Chriſtian, conſider who it is that was ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully contemned, and ſo baſely ſcorned, and all this for thy ſake. See what a fools coat they put upon him, behold what unworthy affronts and affronting indignity is offered to the Son of God. The very Elements themſelves would never have put up this wrong of their Creator, nor let it paſs without revenge, if God for our ſalvation had not otherwiſe ſo ordained and with-held them.</p>
               <p>But neither <hi>Herod,</hi> nor his Officers ſhall ever do any ſuch thing to the perſon of Chriſt any more. For death and hell it ſelf hath long ſince forbad them ſo to do. Chriſt indeed wore that white Garment of our eternal ſalvation, though it was a ſport, and a jeſting matter to the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Herods</hi> compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For this white Rayment was a Token of his unſpotted Paſſion; <hi>and that Jeſus was that Lamb of God without blemiſh, which ſhould gloriouſly take away the ſins of the world,</hi> John 1. Mean while, let us learn ſo to live here, even as Chriſt lived; who had rather be deſpiſed by wicked men, then to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by fawning Flatterers. Do thou ſo likewiſe. Nothing doth ſo corrupt the minds of men, as Flattery. A Paraſites tongue doth more miſchief than a Perſecutors ſword.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Herod</hi> had thus mocked and abuſed Chriſt, he ſends him back again to <hi>Pilate.</hi> He was truly the moſt miſerable of all men, who when Chriſt was offered to him, he thruſt him, and ſhut him out of doors, he had been moſt happy, if he had kept Chriſt when he was freely tendred to him. But the world eſteems nothing more vile than Chriſt, though there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:171778:170"/> more excellent then he. <hi>For in him are hid all the treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge,</hi> Col. 2. In him dwels the God-head bodily, in him is eternal life, which that wretched man baniſht from him, when he returned Chriſt back again unto <hi>Pilate.</hi> Thus Chriſt is again brought back a priſoner, &amp; not only a priſoner, but baſely abuſed; with which abuſe they having made themſelves ſomewhat merry, they ſpue up their rage, &amp; miſerably tormented him as they haled him along. What heart can imagine how our meekeſt Saviour was tyred out with theſe torturing and injurious delaies and draggings? We read once, <hi>That he was weary of his journey,</hi> John 4. How much more may we ſuppoſe was he now tyred, when he could not go at liberty, but was drawn along in fetters and chains by wicked men and that all the night and day, without any reſt allowed him? He was baled and pul'd out of the Garden to <hi>Annas,</hi> from him to <hi>Caiaphas.</hi> And after he was vext and diſquieted there all night with boxings, and buffetings, and ſpittings, and other abuſes, aſſoon as it was light, he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the Council, from the Council to <hi>Pilate,</hi> from him to <hi>Herod,</hi> and again in a hurly burly he was ſent back from <hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>Pilate.</hi> And he was hurried and poſted away in all haſte, for they were inſatiably thirſty after his blood, and one pulling, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thruſting him, 'tis to be ſuppoſed that our Lord had many a ſore fall, becauſe his hands being bound, he was not able to ſave himſelf. See then how much he endured for his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, and our guilt. For if we had not ſinned, he had not ſuffered; and if he had not been guiltleſs, thoſe guilty men had not been ſo inraged againſt him. He was altogether unlike them, and therefore grievous to them to behold, <hi>Wiſ.</hi> 2. And by how much the more they feared he might be ſet at liberty, by ſo much were they more vehemently incenſed againſt him. They were obſtinately reſolved to put him to a moſt ſhame full death; which reſolution could no way be more ſtrengthened, than by delay and doubting, and nothing but affection could any way abate it. And as the Lord Jeſus, by how much the nearer he drew to his death and greater ſufferings from the beginning of his Paſſion, and the more his Paſſion was prolonged, ſo much the more meekneſs and patience he diſcovered: (For when he was firſt laid hands on, he was more rigid, when he hurl'd them on the ground by the Word of Truth: he was leſs ſevere before
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:171778:171"/> 
                  <hi>Annas,</hi> more mild before
<hi>Pilate,</hi> and upon the Croſs he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his Perſecutors with many a tear) So on the contrary, by how much the greater puniſhments the
<hi>Jews</hi> tormented him, by ſo much the more they were imbitter'd againſt him. <hi>The pride of them that hate thee aſcendeth continually,</hi> Pſalm 74. <hi>ult.</hi> But all this while Chriſt never thought of revenge, but of our miſery. For he ſaw that he did not ſuffer theſe things for his own neceſſity, but for love of us. He conſidered our ſins, and out of his greateſt charity willingly underwent whatſoever they impoſed upon him, only that he might redeem us. And therefore he is more thoughtfull to deſtroy our ſins, then he is to eſcape his own ſuffering.</p>
               <p>Theſe things are well to be conſidered; for truly it is a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, juſt, equal and comfortable thing for us always, and in all places to give him thanks, who would be ſo led up and down for us, that he might lead us into the way, and make ſatisfaction for our ſins. But ſee what follows, <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ground of their quarrel was about their Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which of them ſhould be greateſt; or rather becauſe <hi>Pilate</hi> ſlew ſome
<hi>Galileans</hi> which were under <hi>Herods</hi> Power and Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,
<hi>Luk.</hi> 13.1. This grudge continued till Chriſt removed it, by being ſent a Priſoner up and down between them. It was a moſt acceptable thing to <hi>Herod,</hi> that <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhould ſend Chriſt priſoner to him. Now all anger was laid aſide and forgotten. So eaſily do theſe wicked men agree, and become friends in the killing of Chriſt, whom otherwiſe no Vertue, no Juſtice could ſtrike a League between, or reconcile them. Wicked men are ſometimes at ſtrife and variance among themſelves.</p>
               <p>But in this they all agree, to perſecute Chriſt. As concerning Chriſt, <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> yea, <hi>Jews, Gentiles, Turks, Hereticks,</hi> they are all unanimous, however they differ never ſo much otherwiſe among themſelves. Here then that of
<hi>David</hi> is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>Why do the Heathenrage,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>and the people imagine a vain thing? The Kings of the earth ſet themſelves, and the Princes take Counſel together againſt the Lord and againſt his anointed,</hi> Pſalm 2. The Gentiles did rage indeed like bruit beaſts, for they knew not what they did. The people, to wit, the
<hi>Jews</hi> imagined vanity. They laid their heads together, as it is written,
<note place="margin">Pſalm 109.</note> 
                  <hi>They compaſſed me about with words of hatred; the
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:171778:171"/> Kings,</hi> that is, <hi>Pilate</hi> and
<hi>Herod.</hi> Hence the Apoſtles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their mournfull prayer, <hi>Of a truth Lord,</hi> ſay they, <hi>againſt thy holy child Jeſus, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with Gentiles and the people of Iſrael were gathered together,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 4. To this may be added that of the
<hi>Pſalmiſt, They are confederate againſt thee, the Tabernacles of</hi> Edom, <hi>and the</hi> Iſhmaelites, <hi>of</hi> Moab, <hi>and the</hi> Hagarens, Gebal <hi>and</hi> Ammon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 83.</note> They are like
<hi>Sampſons</hi> foxes, their tails be tyed together, and like the ſcales of the Leviathan, ſticking ſo cloſe together, that no air can come between them, <hi>Job</hi> 41. So when it comes to perſecution of the godly, and to propagate ungodlineſs, now wicked men are eaſily reconciled and made friends. But all this while Chriſt is not ſet at liberty, but compel'd to the Croſs, and die he muſt. Thus Tyrants for the moſt part now adays are quickly quiet one with another after they have robbed, and ſpoiled, and plundred, and utterly undone the poor; and not one amongſt them all will reſtore or help the poor man to that which is his right. Concerning this peace of the wicked, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I was envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at the wicked, when I ſaw the proſperity of ſinners,</hi> Pſalm 73. But a little after he ſaith, <hi>Thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery places, thou caſteſt them down into deſtruction. How are they brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſolation as in a moment? They are utterly conſumed with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. As a dream when one awaketh, ſo ſhalt thou make their image to vaniſh out of the City,</hi> Pſalm
73. All this was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in theſe two men, for both of them were baniſhed. It follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And Pilate when he had called together the chief Prieſts, and the Rulers, and the people, ſaid unto them,
<note place="margin">Luk. 23.13.</note> Ye have brought this man unto me, as one that perverteth the people, and Behold, I have examined him before you, and I have found no fault in this man, touching thoſe things whereof ye accuſe him. No, nor yet</hi> Herod; <hi>for I ſent you to him, and lo, nothing worthy of death is done unto him. I will therefore chaſtiſe him, and releaſe him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And when Jeſus was accuſed of the chief Prieſts and Elders,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.12. Mar. 15.3.</note> he anſwered nothing. Then ſaith Pilate unto him, anſwereſt thou nothing? Behold, how many things they witneſs againſt thee. But he anſwered him to never a word, inſomuch that the Governour marvelled greatly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:171778:172"/> Chriſt is now brought back again from
<hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> but ſo, as without doubt many godly men wept to ſee how miſerably he was led along. We uſe to ſay, when innocent men ſuffer, Thieves and Robbers ſhould be thus dealt with, not honeſt and juſt men. But the Lord Chriſt was neither Thief nor Robber, and yet he endured all this, and was ſo toſſed to and fro, from one to another, and with ſuch diſgrace too, that it would have made one ſhed many a tear to ſee the veryeſt Raſcal in the world ſo uſed.
<hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle of this Jeſus was toſt and tumbled up and down in the ſame manner. For as the Lord Jeſus had his <hi>Annas</hi>'s,
<hi>Caiaphas</hi>'s, <hi>Pilates, Herods;</hi> ſo <hi>Paul</hi> had his
<hi>Annanias</hi>'s, <hi>Felix</hi>'s, <hi>Feſtus</hi>'s, <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s, &amp;c. Why ſhould the Scholler ſpeed better then his Maſter? And let it not repent thee, Brother, of the Croſs, be not thou aſhamed of it; for thy Lord and mine did never bluſh at it. Holy truths can no otherways be brought to light; Good men muſt look for no other uſage. <hi>Pilate</hi> and
<hi>Herod</hi> have no better entertainment in their houſes. Innocency, Humility, Simplicity, the Spirit, Knowledge, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are nothing worth in their market, they make but a piff of theſe. Thou muſt be their Mocking-ſtock, and make them fools ſports, yea, though thou wert as good as
<hi>Elias,</hi> unleſs thou will ſay, and do as they pleaſe, that is, to ſay and do the filthieſt and baſeſt wickedneſs in the world. Satan knows his time and advantage, and can tell well enough how and when to make wicked men friends, but ſo, as that their reconciliation ſhall be thy ruine and deſtruction. But <hi>Pilate,</hi> who was a little honeſter than the
<hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Herod,</hi> that he may ſeem not to wrong any man, doth once more call together the chief of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and leaves no ſtone unturned, but uſeth all means poſſible to ſet Jeſus at liberty, and releaſe him ſafe and ſound.</p>
               <p>Ye have brought this man to me, ſaith he, and have accuſed him of many things, and I have examined him as ſtrictly and as narrowly as poſſibly I can to ſift out the truth, and ſound the buſineſs to the very bottom to bring things to light. I have taken him aſide, and asked him alone, and examined him in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate; and now I have queſtioned him in your preſence, before your own faces, and yet I cannot hear or underſtand any thing, but that he is wrong'd exceedingly, and all that I can do for my life and heart, I can find no cauſe of death in him. And if ye
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:171778:172"/> will not believe me, behold <hi>Herod</hi> alſo his own Lord, under whoſe juriſdiction he is, doth think and ſay the ſame, he is of one mind and opinion with me in this matter. For he under whoſe power he is, hath ſent him back again without puniſhment: which he would never have done, if he had found him faulty. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will ye do, ſeeing according to the truth of the buſineſs, there is nothing to be found in this man worthy of reprehenſion, or wherefore he ſhould be put to death? Will you uſe violence to him, and kill him contrary to all Law and Reaſon? Doth your Law teach you to ſerve men ſo? Surely <hi>Solon, Lycurgus, Minos,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Tables allow no ſuch thing, much leſs command it. The chiefeſt Law of <hi>Lycurgus</hi> was, that no man ſhould be puniſhed before he was convicted and condemned. Nor did ever any Law-maker allow of ſo notorious a wickedneſs, as to cut off and deſtroy the innocent. How much leſs ought you to do any ſuch thing, who go under the name of Religion, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the moſt holy Law? Let me deſire you therefore to hearken to my advice, which I ſuppoſe may ſomewhat pacifie you. I will chaſtiſe and ſcourge him after the manner of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that it may not be ſaid you have bound him and brought him before me without a cauſe: but I neither can, nor will I put him to death, becauſe I find no ſuch fault in him. See here <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> doth again bear witneſs of Chriſts innocency againſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> that by the righteous Judgement of God their damnation might be the greater. You ſhall ſhortly ſee the Sun, and the Heavens, the Earth, and the ſtones teſtifie againſt them, and proclaim the innocency of Chriſt. Nor could they be thus aſſwaged: but when they heard that he ſhould be releaſed, they cryed out the more vehemently, and were more impatient then before. Thoſe bloody minded men would be ſatisfied with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but his death. They would have the memory of him wholly aboliſhed. Therefore they thought it not enough, and could not be contented that Chriſt ſhould only be chaſtiſed, and ſcape with nothing but ſcourges.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt makes no further anſwer to all that they charged upon him, no not when <hi>Pilate</hi> queſtioned and chid him for it. For all that they objected againſt him, did not deſerve an anſwer. Well might he be ſilent, who had no need to make his defence. Let them go about to defend themſelves (ſaith <hi>Ambroſe</hi>) who are
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:171778:173"/> afraid to be worſted in their cauſe. He doth not then confirm their Accuſation by his ſilence, but ſleights it by not wrangling againſt it. <hi>Pilate</hi> indeed takes it in great dudgin and diſdain, that he who had anſwered ſo handſomely before him in private, ſhould now ſay nothing before the people. And therefore firſt he doth wonder at his patience; for never in all his life before did he know any man that was accuſed, but he would uſe his tongue to the utmoſt to plead for his life, and ſeek by all means poſſible to defend himſelf. Secondly, He doth admire, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he was guiltleſs, he doth not petition for his liberty and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement. Thirdly, He doth think it ſtrange, that he was no more afraid to dye. He ſees no cauſe he had to be ſilent, but great reaſon why he ſhould ſpeak for himſelf: becauſe he that is convicted ſhould ſtop his mouth and hold his peace, and not he that is innocent and clear.</p>
               <p>Here then was fulfilled that of <hi>David: But I was as a deaf man, and heard not; and as a dumb man, that openeth not his mouth. I was as a man that heareth not, and in whoſe mouth are no reproofs,</hi> Pſalm 38. Chriſt by this his Example taught us what Weapons Chriſtians ought to fight with againſt Death and the deceits of the World, and againſt the Accuſations of our Adverſaries: to wit, with innocency, patience, and ſilence. In quietneſs and in confidence ſhall be your ſtrength,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. It follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now at the Feaſt the Governour was wont to releaſe unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple a priſoner,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.15.</note> whom they would. And they had then a notable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner, called</hi> Barabbas. <hi>Which lay bound with them that had made inſurrection with him, who had committed murther in the inſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And the multitude crying out, began to deſire him to do as he had ever done unto them,</hi> Mar. 15.7. Pilate <hi>ſaith unto them, ye have a cuſtom that I ſhould releaſe one unto you at the Paſsover,</hi> John 18.39. <hi>When they were gathered together, he ſaid unto them, Whom will ye that I releaſe unto you?</hi> Barabbas, <hi>or Jeſus (the King of the Jews) which is called Chriſt? For he knew that for envy they (the chief Prieſts) had delivered him,</hi> Mat. 27.17. <hi>But the chief Prieſts and Elders ſtirred up the multitude, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them that they ſhould rather ask</hi> Barabbas, <hi>and deſtroy Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. The Governour anſwered and ſaid unto them: Whether of the twain will ye that I releaſe unto you? And the whole multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude cryed out all at once, ſaying, away with this man, and releaſe
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:171778:173"/> unto us</hi> Barabbas, Luk. 23.18. Pilate
<hi>therefore willing to releaſe Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſpake again to them, and ſaid, what will ye then that I ſhall do with Jeſus, whom ye call the King of the</hi> Jews? <hi>And they all cryed out again, Crucifie him, Crucifie him. He ſaith unto them the third time: why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cauſe of death in him: I will therefore chaſtiſe him and let him go. And they cryed the more, ſaying, let him be crucified. And they were inſtant with loud voyces, requiring that he might be crucified: and the voyces of them, and of the chief Prieſts prevailed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This cuſtom of releaſing one priſoner at the Paſsover, aroſe from their deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> which was upon the day of the Paſsover. And this cuſtom had a great ſhew of piety in it, but it was clean contrary to the law of God, which command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that none but offenders ſhould be puniſhed. Nor had the <hi>Iews</hi> any need to be put in mind of their deliverance heretofore out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> by this releaſing of a priſoner. For God himſelf had Inſtituted a memorable and remarkable ſign of this thing, to wit, the Paſchal Lamb, and ſo that whole Feſtival. But they, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with this ſign which God had Inſtituted, did inſtitute ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that quite contrary to the Law of God. Thus Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites are not content with the bare Word of God, but alwayes either add ſomething of their own invention unto it, or prefer it before the Word of God.</p>
               <p>But again we here ſee a moſt notable paſſage of prudence and civil righteouſneſs in <hi>Pilate.</hi> And I heartily wiſh that we might have no worſe and more indiſcreet Magiſtrates. Indeed we do deſire good and godly Princes in a Common-wealth. But if for our iniquities we do deſerve none but ungodly Magiſtrates, we wiſh they may be as good and as prudent as <hi>Pilate</hi> was. For con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider I pray,</p>
               <p n="1">1. With what Wiſdom he endeavoured to ſet Chriſt at liberty. For when he could not do it by force and might, becauſe of the peoples uproar, and the power and importunity of the High Prieſts, he attempts it in a wiſe and judicious way, propoſing their own cuſtom, and offering to give them ſatisfaction before they deſired it at his hands. For by this means he hoped to have bowed the <hi>Jews,</hi> and made their minds flexible to him herein, ſo that they would have yielded and have been willing to releaſe Chriſt, inaſmuch as he offered to confirm their cuſtom with ſuch
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:171778:174"/> readineſs, though he were an Heathen, and thereby to ſhew no ſmall favour to their Kingdom. <hi>Ye have a Cuſtom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth very wiſely propound thoſe two, and no more, unto them. He doth propoſe no other with Chriſt unto them, but that notorious Villain <hi>Barabbas,</hi> whom he knew to be a moſt miſchievous and peſtilent fellow to them all: ſo that it could not be ſuſpected that they would abſolve him, but when he had ſet them both before them, they might be put in mind of what both of them had done. <hi>Whether of the twain,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>would ye,</hi> &amp;c. And he calleth Jeſus
<hi>the King of the</hi> Jews, that ſo he might ſeem either a little to appeach their Kingdom, or at leaſt abate and mitigate their fury with ſome laughter and merriment, and withall ſhew them that he was falſly accuſed of this crime. For a <hi>Roman</hi> Viceroy would never have releaſed one that was accuſed to undermine the <hi>Roman</hi> Government, if but in the leaſt he had apprehended him to be guilty. The <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> on the contrary do deſcribe and ſet forth this Thief in his colours, that the malice of the <hi>Jews</hi> may appear to be the greater, who would prefer ſuch a Rogue before Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Now <hi>Barabbas</hi> ſignifieth a Son of the Father, that is, of the Devil or Antichriſt: for according to <hi>Matthew</hi> he was not ſimply, but notoriouſly wicked. He was a ſeditious fellow, a Thief, and a Murtherer. Hence <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith. <hi>ye deſired a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer to be granted to you, and have killed the Prince of Life,</hi> Act. 3.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Barabbas</hi> alſo may be interpreted the ſon of a multitude, or the ſon of a Maſter. For he had the ſame Father to be his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, which taught <hi>Iudas</hi> to betray his Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He is truly a ſon of the multitude, that is, a ſon of the World. To this fellow then is Chriſt likened and compared, the moſt innocent man with the moſt notorious robber, yea the moſt precious Son of God, with the very child of the Devil himſelf. This was figured forth by the two Goats under the Law, upon which the Prieſt (<hi>Levit.</hi> 16.) was commanded to caſt Lots, which ſhould be ſlain, and which ſhould be the ſcape-Goat. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabbas</hi> was that one ſtinking Goat, the other Goat was Chriſt: who according to his innocency was a Lamb; but according to our iniquities, and in reference to our ſins which he took upon
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:171778:174"/> him, he was as it were a Goat. This is ſlain, and the other is let go. But as he that ſlew the Goat, did ſprinkle his blood upon the Altar, that God might be propitious: but he that led away the ſcape-Goat was thereby made unclean, till he had waſhed himſelf with water: So by the blood of Chriſt the Fathers anger is pacified and alaid again. But the <hi>Iews</hi> who deſired <hi>Barabbas</hi> to be releaſed unto them, are become unclean, and never can be clean, untill they be waſhed by the blood of Chriſt. But hear the Vote, and how the Lot falls.
<hi>Pilate</hi> did not doubt but that they would adjudge Chriſt to be ſet at liberty, rather then a common Cutter upon the High way, but he was much miſtaken herein. For the chief Prieſts had otherwiſe perſwaded the common Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of people, to wit, that they ſhould deſire <hi>Barabbas</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed to them, but that Jeſus ſhould not only be kept in hold, but alſo condemned to a moſt filthy and ſhamefull death. This, ſaith he, thoſe Princes and prime men perſwaded the people unto. Therefore they eſpecially are guilty of ſhedding Chriſts blood more then the reſt. See here how peſtilent and pernitious an evil Counſellour is. The multitude of the people at firſt were wholly for Chriſt, and did generally follow and cleave to him. But now theſe wicked men having prevailed with them, they cry out againſt him, and deſire to have him put to death. <hi>The whole multitude,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>cryed out, Away with him, and releaſe unto us</hi> Barabbas. O notorious blindneſs, or madneſs rather. For what elſe was this but to ſay, kill him that raiſed the dead, and ſet him at liberty who killed the living; put out the light, and let us ſit in darkneſs: Away with the Peace maker, and let the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous and ſeditious alone. We will not accept of Life, we deſire Death rather: Let Truth be baniſht, we chuſe falſhood before it. Finally, they ſcorn ſo much as to mention the very Name of Chriſt, but they cry out for <hi>Barabbas</hi> to be ſet at liberty: they had rather celebrate the Paſsover with him, then with Jeſus: for although he were a lewd and wicked fellow, yet he was more tolerable to them, becauſe he never uſed to reprove them for their faults: but Chriſt was an intolerable man, not to be born by them, becauſe he rebuked them for their Vices. This then is that complaint made in <hi>Iſaiah: I looked for Righteouſneſs, but behold a cry,</hi> Iſa. 5. So in
<hi>Jeremy, Mine heritage is unto me at a Lyon in the Forreſt: it cryeth out againſt me, therefore,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 12.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:171778:175"/> For as the Lyon terrifieth the other creatures with his roaring voyce, ſo theſe men by their out-cry did force the Lord unto the Croſs.</p>
               <p>This people therefore did here commit two evils, as it is ſaid in <hi>Ieremy</hi> the ſecond. <hi>They have forſaken me the Fountain of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving water, and have digged to themſelves broken Ciſterns that can hold no water.</hi> The firſt evil was, in that they thought a guilty perſon more fit to be releaſed, then an innocent man. The ſecond was, in that they would offer to condemn their beſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. It is not ſo bad to deſire the inlargement of an offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but to chuſe it, and that rather to deſire the freedom of a wicked man, then of a godly man, this can never be good in any ſenſe. We that are Chriſtians ought to pray for all men, yea for Infidels, but mean while willingly to forget thoſe that are of one Faith together with us, this muſt needs be evil.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The <hi>Iews</hi> by this their out-rage did notably lay open their ingratitude, in that they did ſo baſely eſteem of him, who ſet ſo great a rate on them, as to chuſe them for his people before all others.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They did betray the madneſs of their malice, which was ſo great, that they rather deſired all righteouſneſs ſhould be utterly ruined, and that all malice ſhould have its ſwinge, then that the current of their hatred ſhould be ſtopt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here they bewray their great blindneſs, becauſe they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that which by all means they ſhould have feared, avoided, and prayed againſt, to wit, that their Saviour might not be cut off, and a Robber releaſed to them. But as they deſired both, ſo it befell them: They choſe a Thief, and rejected a Saviour: juſtly therefore are they expoſed to the Sword and Robbers without any Saviour. They asked a Murtherer to be given them, but kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Prince of Life, for which very thing they periſhed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and murthers, and were, and are involved in ſuch great calamities, that none is able by Pen or Tongue ſufficiently to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them. And for this very fact the Prophets call that Nation the daughter of a Robber. Well doth <hi>Iſaias</hi> alſo ſpeak of them:
<hi>Ah ſinfull Nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, children that are corrupters, they have forſaken the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. Here we ſee,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there is nothing but a wicked mind will prefer it
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:171778:175"/> before Chriſt and the truth, if it doth but know and hope it ſhall get never ſo little by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are taught not to truſt in the applauſe of the world. For they who but a little while ſince did ſing before Chriſt,
<hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord:</hi> now cry out as loud, <hi>Away with him,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here we ſee the diſpoſition of the world, which doth ever make choyce of the worſt, and reject the beſt. It is alway more favourable to the guilty, then the innocent. But all that we here ſee or hear of did not fall out by chance, but by the Decree and Counſell of God. For it behooved Chriſt to be made the loweſt of men, and to fall under the greateſt contempt, that he might be moſt highly exalted and glorified over all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. The loweſt deſcent of Chriſt was, to be accounted more baſe and wicked then a Thief or a Robber: but this Deſcention is a means of his Aſcention, and the true and only way for him to be more highly exalted. If thou therefore art deſpiſed, and reckoned worſe then the worſt, have recourſe preſently to Chriſt, who in the ſence of ſo great contempt transfer'd it on himſelf, and overcame it, that thou by Faith in him mighteſt overcome it alſo. No marvell then if guiltleſs men be ſometimes puniſhed, and the guilty eſcape Scot-free. So it was with Chriſt. And as it here fell out in <hi>Pilates</hi> Court, the very ſame happened in Gods Court. <hi>Adam</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Thief with his whole poſterity ſtood accuſed before God, all of them guilty of Death: So did alſo the moſt innocent Son of God. Now one of them muſt be puniſhed with Death, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice did ſo require it. But God of his great mercy ſpared him, and delivered his own innocent Son to Death for him.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Brethren, let us embrace this mercy of God, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full unto him for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Let us take heed that Chriſt, that is, the Righteouſneſs of God be not taken and kept priſoner in us: and the Thief, that is, unrighteouſneſs, be not let go at random.</p>
               <p>But what doth <hi>Pilate</hi> do, when he ſaw this frantick obſtinacy of the <hi>Jews?</hi> He little thought that they would deſire
<hi>Barab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> to be releaſed unto them. And nothing ſeemed more ſtrange unto him then this unworthy behaviour of them. Therefore he ſaith,
<hi>What then ſhall I do with Jeſus?</hi> &amp;c. q.d. If ye think it
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:171778:176"/> meet and juſt that a Thief ſhould have his inlargement, much more he that is proved to be innocent: or with what juſtice can I condemn this man, if a Thief muſt be releaſed inſtead of him? ye deſire that he ſhould be ſent packing, but require a Thief to be ſet at liberty. Nay in requiring a Thiefs enlargement, ye do neceſſarily deſire this mans releaſment. For he that would an offender let go, would much more that a Righteous man ſhould not be kept priſoner. And ſo is it indeed with thoſe that are in their right wits: but malice had blinded theſe mens eyes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cry out again: <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him.</hi> Theſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Husbandmen had a will and a reſolution to kill the Lord of the Vineyard, thinking that then they ſhould poſſeſs his Inheritance ſafely, and hold it ſure enough, and ſo brave it out with great gladneſs and glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. Wherefore they ſharpened their Tongues like Serpents. But firſt of all they determine what kind of death he ſhould dye. Where again they diſcover their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, in that they would preſcribe what manner of death to put him unto, whereas this did not belong to the Accuſers, but to the Judge. And twas not for nothing that they would have him crucified. For thereby they thought to delude the people, and alienate them from Chriſt: that whereas it is written in the Law,
<hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree;</hi> they might ſhew them that Chriſt alſo was accurſed of God, and ſo by that means Chriſt might wholly periſh, not only in his perſon, but in his good Name and repute among the people, and the clearneſs of his Miracles, and whatever elſe was good in him. This was that which that wicked crew did plot and purpoſe, even that the whole memory of Chriſt might utterly be aboliſhed. But God croſſed their contrivances. For the curſe of the Croſs was far from clouding Chriſts Renown, that his Glory did the more ſparkle and ſpread thereby. Let not us think ſhame of the Croſs of Chriſt, but eſteem it our greateſt honour. Let us now glory in nothing ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. For this will turn all curſing into bleſſing to us.</p>
               <p>But how madly ſoever they cry out, <hi>Pilate</hi> doth yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and doth the third time publiquely proteſt Chriſts innocency. <hi>What evil,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hath he done? I find no fault in him.</hi> For he knew, and now had ſufficient experience by the fact it ſelf, that for envy they had delivered him. Nothing but
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:171778:176"/> envy (I ſay) was the ground of all this clamour. For this had ſo blinded them, that they could not ſee the Law of God, or of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. A manifeſt and plain Sign and Token of this their envy was, in that they took no notice of the Judges excuſing him, but ſtill cryed out more and more; and what elſe ſhould they do, when they had nothing elſe to prove their charge? In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the world afterward cryed out againſt the Martyrs of Chriſt, <hi>The curſe of the Croſs light on them, Away with them, Throw them to the beaſts, make dogs meat of them, Hence with theſe Malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors,</hi> &amp;c. How ſhould they ſcape better then their Lord? But though Ravens or Lyons devour us; although the fire burn us, or the water drown us: let us never deny Chriſt, or deſert his Church. It follows in the Text:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> Pilate <hi>therefore took Jeſus, and ſcourged him.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 19.1. Mar. 15.16. Mat. 27.28.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Souldiers led him away into the Hall, called</hi> Pretorium, <hi>and they call together the whole band. And they ſtripped him, and put on him a ſcarlet Robe. And when they had platted a Crown of Thorns, they put it upon his head, and a Reed in his right hand: and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, ſaying, Hail King of the</hi> Jews (<hi>And began to ſalute him, Hail,</hi> &amp;c. Mar. 15.) <hi>And they ſmote him with their hands</hi> (John 19.3.) <hi>And they ſpit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and took the Reed, and ſmote him on the head;</hi> (Mat. 27.30.) <hi>And bowing their knees, worſhipped him,</hi> (Mar. 15.19.)</p>
               <p>The Devil now at laſt, through the furious rage of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> ſo far prevailed with <hi>Pilate,</hi> who endeavoured to carry on things in a politique way of Juſtice, to lay violent hands on Chriſt. I ſay he laid hands on him, whom he had ſo often excuſed. For ſo the Scripture muſt be fulfilled. <hi>Pilate</hi> knew well enough that for envy they had delivered him, and yet he doth ſo far gratifie and condeſcend unto them, that for their ſakes, and in favour to them, he doth ſuffer and command innocent Jeſus to be ſcourged. And how many ſuch
<hi>Pilatiſts</hi> are there to be found now adayes in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Countrey, who commonly Apprehend, Oppreſs, Spoyl, Kill, and condemn even the innocent, for no other cauſe, but becauſe it will pleaſe their Princes? <hi>Pilate</hi> might have reſcued Chriſt out of the hands of the <hi>Jews,</hi> having power and force ſufficient to have done it, as <hi>Lyſias</hi> the
<hi>Tribune</hi> or chief Captain did reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 21. But thus it muſt be. Chriſt foreknew and foretold his ſcourging long before,
<hi>Mar.</hi> 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 18.

Of which uſage Chriſt warned and told them of before-hand, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. &amp; 23. But let us explain the words of this Text a little more largely. Hitherto ye have heard what Chriſt ſuffered from the <hi>Jews:</hi> to wit, that he was taken hold on, bound, hurried up and down, buffeted, accuſed, ſpit on, in fine he was accounted worſe then a common Thief. Now we ſhall hear what he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the
<hi>Gentiles</hi> after all this. Although what we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy heard was ſufficient to have redeemed all the world, yet he would endure more than that: Firſt that he might make full ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our ſins: Secondly, That none might have any oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to deſpair, conſidering the largeneſs of the Remedy: Thirdly. To re-enkindle our love again unto him, becauſe it is as it were natural for a man to be won and wrought upon by courteſies and kindneſs. Hence in the Prophet ſuch Benefits and good Turns are called <hi>the Cords of Adam, Hoſ.</hi> 11. Such as with which a man is drawn. <hi>I will draw them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>with the cords of Adam,</hi> that is, with Benefits and Kindneſſes whereto men eaſily incline and ſuffer themſelves to be prevailed on. And whom would not this ſo great love of Chriſt draw unto himſelf? <hi>Pilate</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>took Jeſus, and ſcourged him.</hi> This was the firſt Sentence of the Judge againſt Chriſt, and that a moſt unjuſt one too: inaſmuch as the Judge himſelf had more then once de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him to be guiltleſs already. But this is Chriſts Lot in the world, that although men know him to be innocent, yet he fares no better, and meets with no civiller uſage at their hands: which is no other then what all the Saints, who are members of Chriſt, ever have had, and ſtill have experience of continually. For how often are wicked men compelled to confeſs, and ſay, Verily this was an honeſt man: but for all that they will ſhew him no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther favour; this is all the kindneſs he ſhall receive at their hands, or is likely to find from them. Now according to the opinion of ſome Chriſt was whipt,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe it was the cuſtom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> firſt to ſtrip and whip thoſe openly that were to be put to death, to ſhew that they had nothing to cover or excuſe their fault. Although this
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:171778:178"/> is true in part, yet it doth not hold here. For Chriſt was not yet condemned to die: Nay, the Judge himſelf had not as yet reſolved to adjudge him to death, and therefore in favour to him did but chaftiſe him. He ſaw that the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo drunken with ſuch envy againſt Chriſt, and did ſo rage againſt him, that they could not be kept from killing him with all the Rhetorical Eloquence and fair perſwaſions that he could uſe to them. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. To avoid a greater miſchief, to wit, the putting of the innocent to death, therefore he gave ſentence that Chriſt ſhould be ſcourged, if happily the <hi>Jews</hi> being ſatisfied with this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, might abate the rage and fury of their minds; for of two evils, the leaſt is to be choſen. This is all the pitty that the world hath of Chriſt, even to beat him with many ſtripes. Let us look on this with the eyes of our mind. It is a great ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle for the World, Angels and Men to behold, that the Prince of all liberty ſhould in ſuch a ſervile and baſe manner be beaten and buffeted by the ſlaves and vaſſals of ſin. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He that cloaths and covers all, is ſtript of his own gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and led up and down naked before all men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He that covereth our confuſion, is confounded before all, that we might not eternally be confounded; which certainly we muſt have been, if Chriſt had not undergone this ſtripping and whipping for us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He that releaſeth the Priſoners, is himſelf brought into bonds; Nay, he that gave the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> a cloud and pillar of fire to conduct them when they came out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> is by the ſame men bound now to a pillar himſelf: Although this alſo had ſome good reſemblance of the rectitude of his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for he always ſtood upright.</p>
               <p n="4">4. He that with much pitty and compaſſion touched the ſick and weak, is now brought under the laſh, and is beaten with ſo many ſtripes, ſo many ſtrokes, and with ſo many ſcourges, that if the God-head had not ſupplyed him with freſh ſtrength to endure more laſhes and blows, he had ſunk, and dyed under the hands of thoſe raſcallions for want of breath and blood. Thus they add ſtripe to ſtripe, gaſh to gaſh, rent upon rent, wound upon wound, blood upon blood, till that beauteous and comely body, which was more lovely than any the children of men, was
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:171778:179"/> wholly deformed and disfigured, that as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>It had no form or comlineſs, Iſa.</hi> 53. Here was fulfilled that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Supra dorſum meum fabricaverunt piccatores, The plowers plowed upon my back,</hi> Pſalm 129. Again, <hi>From the ſole of the foot to the crown of the head, there is no ſoundneſs in him,</hi> Iſa. 1.</p>
               <p>All this he underwent and endured for our ſakes: Our ſins were his ſcourges; ſo many ſins as thou haſt committed, ſo many ſcourges Chriſt ſuffered. For it is written, <hi>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our peace was upon him, and with his ſtripes are we healed.</hi> Sins do juſtly deſerve ſcourges, which ſeeing they were innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and yet Chriſt had undertaken them all, yea, and God himſelf would exact the puniſhments of all ſinners at his hands, there's no doubt but this whipping was moſt grievous to be born, eſpecially if we conſider the moſt noble and tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of Chriſts body. So that Chriſt did like a natural and meek mother, who ſeeing the Father diſpleaſed and angry with his Children, runs with her arms all abroad, and ſteps between, taking the blows on her ſelf to ſave her children. So Chriſt run to meet the Father when he ſaw him incenſed with our ſins, and ſuddenly providing perpetual plagues for us, offering his own back to bear our blows. O the unſpeakable bounty of God, by which it was that we were ſo dearly redeemed. O the ſtrange Judgement and Correction; O the wonderfull ordering of the unutterable Myſterie! The wicked offendeth, and the righteous is puniſhed: the ſervant commits an heynous crime, and the Lord makes ſatisfaction for it. Man doth the Fact, and God bears the blame.</p>
               <p>Whither, O thou Son of God, whither doth thy humility deſcend? Whither did the fire of thy love flame? What were the bounds of thy pitty and piety? How far did thy compaſſion extend? I did the evil, and ſhould have born the puniſhment. I committed the wickedneſs, but thou didſt penance, and ſufferedſt vengeance for it. Thou waſt humbled for my pride. I was diſobedient, but thou waſt moſt obedient in all things, yet doſt thou expiate the haynouſneſs of my rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion. I did eat the ſower grapes, and thy teeth were ſet on edge. I wretched man, and undone Creature, I ſay, I was the cauſe of all thy bruiſings, and of all thy confuſions. Thy love and
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:171778:179"/> my ſin made thee become ſo weak. Conſider this, O thou mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable ſinner, conſider of this when thou makeſt proviſion to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh. Here we ſee how that,</p>
               <p n="1">1. We were not redeemed with corruptible things, as Silver and Gold, <hi>But with the precious blood of the unſpotted Lamb,</hi> 1 Pet.
1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. How Chriſt made ſatisfaction for the ſins of the fleſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. How the loſt ſheep is not only found, but brought home again upon the ſhoulders of the good ſhepherd with great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and toyl. Wo to thoſe miſerable men that polluted their hands in the blood of the innocent. And wo be to us alſo, if we be not thankfull.</p>
               <p>But there is ſomething elſe to be taken notice of in this whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of Chriſt: for while the world is ſo buſie about ſcourging of Chriſt, God is not idle, or neglecting his care in the mean time towards thoſe that are his. The Lord is wont to do his work, when wicked men are active in theirs for the trouble and affliction of the godly. When the Patriarchs ſold their harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and fulfil'd their luſt upon him, then did God carry on his deſign, and accompliſh his work. For under that ſale of him did God ſecretly advance <hi>Joſeph</hi> to have dominion over his brethren. So here, When <hi>Pilate</hi> and the
<hi>Jews</hi> did their buſineſs in this whipping of Chriſt, mean while alſo God doth his work as faſt. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. He hath ſo ſanctified and bleſſed all ſtripes and all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons by theſe ſcourgings of his Son, that what afflictions ſoever do now befall a godly man, they do him more good than hurt, and help him forward in the way of holineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By theſe ſtripes wherewith Chriſt was beaten, God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath ſo ordered it, that all the ſcourges of a godly man ſhall proſper to his good.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God hath here declared in his only begotten Son what uſage his adopted and elected Children muſt look for in this world. For if he ſuffered his only begotten Son to be whipt, ſhall he not much more let his adopted Children be ſlaſht? <hi>For whom the Lord loveth, he correcteth,</hi> Prov. 3. <hi>And ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth.</hi> What will they ſay to theſe things, who live in pleaſures, and never think of adverſity; ſo far are they from being willing to ſuffer the leaſt and lighteſt croſs, as if they
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:171778:180"/> went about to build another Paradiſe in the earth? <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>That which I have built, I will break down; and ſeekeſt thou great things for thy ſelf?</hi> Jer. 45. They whoſe Judgement it was not to drink of the cup, have drank of it; and doſt thou think to eſcape? Learn therefore, O Chriſtian, from this ſcourging of Chriſt, to bear the ſcourge of God patiently, and ſay with
<hi>David, In flagella paratus ſum, I am ready for the Rod,</hi> as the vulgar reading is, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 38.17. And with <hi>Paul, I am ready not to be bound only but alſo to die at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for the name of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Act. 21.</p>
               <p>Hitherto we have heard of the whipping of Chriſt, which indeed had been ſufficient for the redemption of all mankind. But all is not at an end yet, the wickedneſs of perfidious men, as well of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as of the ſouldiers, is not yet ſatisfied; but affliction is added to the afflicted, and the injuries of our King abound, the pain of his manifold puniſhments and reproaches increaſe more and more. Aſſoon as they had done whipping him, <hi>Pilates</hi> ſouldiers, (who were then under the
<hi>Roman</hi> pay, and kept garriſon at <hi>Jeruſalam</hi> under the Governour, becauſe of the frequent ſeditions and mutinies of the
<hi>Jews</hi>) they begin to mock and make ſport with Chriſt, and that with ſuch looſeneſs and ſawcineſs, that the like was never ſeen or heard of before: no, nor were it to be believed, if the Evangeliſts had not ſo punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſet down every particular. We do not read that <hi>Pilate</hi> commanded theſe things to be done, but the ſouldiers did it of their own accord, to gratifie and curry favour with the <hi>Jews.</hi> However
<hi>Pilate</hi> winks at it, holds his peace, takes no notice of it, he doth not reſtrain or forbid them. Whence ſome ſuſpect that <hi>Pilate</hi> all this while did but with a counterfeit mind defend and plead for Chriſt, but really and indeed did conſpire his death with the <hi>Jews.</hi> And therefore we heard before that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour ſent a band of <hi>Roman</hi> fouldiers to take Chriſt. Whereas if the ſouldiers had done this without
<hi>Pilates</hi> privity, yet <hi>Pilate</hi> could not be excuſed, who did not ſo much as check them, or ſpeak one word in diſlike of their great malice againſt the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Wherefore, O Chriſtians, ſeriouſly conſider again, and think upon this ſo great ſuffering; but withall, take notice, that our ſins were the cauſe thereof.
<note place="margin">Eight jeers.</note> That Prophecy of
<hi>David</hi> was here many ways fulfilled in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22 &amp; 39. &amp; 69. There are eight
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:171778:180"/> manner of jeers reckoned up which theſe knaves put upon Chriſt, for which no doubt the <hi>Jews</hi> did well reward them: nor would they march out to take Chriſt for nothing. For truly Officers of an Army are but vaſſals to Gold. That ſide which allows the beſt pay, hath the juſteſt cauſe. But theſe were <hi>Tiberian</hi> and heathen Souldiers. What then are ours, and what do our ſou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>diers do, who are baptized for Chriſtians? What people under the ſun are worſe, and leſs fearing God? Thoſe ſouldiers of <hi>Tiberius</hi> did ſcourge, crown, mock, ſpit on, and at laſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie Chriſt: But our ſouldiers, whom we daily ſee before our eyes, do no leſs to Chriſt, by ſwearing and blaſpheming the blood and wounds of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No wonder if ſuch ſouldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were always worſted, not only by the <hi>Turks,</hi> but alſo if the earth had ſwallowed them up alive. And no queſtion but the earth and the people therein are the worſe for ſuch kind of Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies. For is it not a diabolical thing, that Chriſtians know not what elſe to ſwear by, but by that by which they are redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? But of this we ſhall ſpeak elſewhere. Let us now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider thoſe eight things which Chriſt ſuffered from thoſe ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They muſter up the whole deviliſh band together, to make the greater mockery and deriſion of it. Surely 'tis no ſmall vexation to be jeered at by one ſingle perſon alone; how much more to be made a laughing ſtock before ſo many men?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The band being called together, they clothe, and put on him a purple robe, which was a military garment of a red co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which Commanders uſe to wear. The military attire of other ſouldiers was called a Corſlet, or Coat of Male. This they did ſcoffingly, to ſignifie thereby that he was a King. <hi>Herods</hi> ſervants put a white robe upon Chriſt, theſe clothe him in ſcarlet.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They plat a Crown of Thorns, and ſet it on his holy head for a royal Diadem. Who can imagine the pain that reverend Head indured by ſo many prickly thorns faſtned on it, when we are ſo tormented with the prick of a thorn that we can hardly endure it?
<note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt, Then theſe thorns were the covetouſneſs and riches of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which moved them to perſecute Chriſt. The world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be content to ſcratch it ſelf with its own thorns, <hi>i. e.</hi> Riches, but it muſt vex its Neighbour too, and diſhonour God, either by getting them diſhoneſtly, or keeping them too niggardly.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:171778:181"/>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, Theſe thorns are our ſins. For becauſe of mans ſin, the earth fell under this curſe, that it ſhould bring forth thiſtles and thorns, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. So that we alſo as well as the ſouldiers did put this Crown of thorns upon the holy head of Jeſus. For 'twas we that ſinned, though Chriſt bare the puniſhment of our ſins. See and conſider this thou graceleſs and grateleſs man, who doſt now give up thy ſelf to vanity and pleaſure, while Chriſt ſits with a Crown of thorns on his head. See, I ſay, how grievouſly Chrirſt was afflicted for the expiating of our pride and vanity. For this Crown, beſides the pain that it cauſed, was contemptuous and reproachfull, it was full of confuſion. Both which were our due, as well the puniſhment, as the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſuſion. Wherefore Chriſt underwent both for us. O the unſpeakble charity of Chriſt indeed towards us! But on the contrary; O the deteſtable ingratitude of us for the ſame!</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſouldiers put a Reed into the hands of Chriſt for his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scepter, and this they did out of diſdain to him, thereby ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that he had made himſelf a King, and yet he had nothing to carry it out in the port of a King: but ſuch as his Scepter was, ſuch was his Kingdom, even a vain empty and frail Kingdom.</p>
               <p n="5">5. They bowed the knee before him, mocking and ſcoffing at him in that ſcornfull ſalutation, ſaying, <hi>Hail King of the Jews.</hi> Here we may much bewail the great malice of theſe wicked men. For how could they have more baſely abuſed the moſt vile and contemptible man in the world? and yet for all that our Jeſus doth ſtill continue to be the true King of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> even in ſpite of <hi>Pilate</hi> and his ſouldiers, notwithſtanding they had uſed him worſe than they did. I ſay he is ſtill a King, now they are hurried into the infernal fire to be burned everlaſtingly. Therefore we are not aſhamed to hear of thoſe unheard of abuſes of our Lord, but are thereby rather ſtrengthened and incouraged to undergo the like. Now theſe wicked Worſhippers ſhadowed thoſe Hypocrites, who by their outward deportment and a piſh geſtures feign themſelves to be very godly people, when their hearts are lewd and unbelieving, and moſt remote from God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. They ſmote him on the face with the palms of their hands. There is nothing more cruel, and more void of all compaſſion than a wicked man. And therefore in the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Chriſt are compared to Lions, Buls, Dogs and Calves,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:171778:181"/> by reaſon of their petulancy and cruelty. Moreover, Ungodly men do always add ſin unto ſin, as if they could never ſin enough. Hence ſaith <hi>Iſaiah, Wo unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity,</hi> Iſa. 5. After they had done mocking Chriſt, they buffet him. They fall from jeſt to earneſt, from ſport to ſpurning, from words to blows; for ſo wicked men are wont firſt to ſcoff, then to ſtrike, and ſo to ſpue up and diſgorge all their rage and fury againſt thoſe that are made miſerable. Thus it befell Chriſt the King of all Glory, and thus it befalls all thoſe that bear his Croſs after him. However we know that as all ſcourgings and whippings, ſo all buffetings and beatings which the godly do undergo, are all ſanctified in Chriſt. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he that gives blow for blow, what elſe doth he but thruſt away, and caſt off ſanctification from him?</p>
               <p n="7">7. They ſpit upon him, which is the higheſt diſdain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all. Eternal God, how comes it to paſs that thy creature man ſhould be ſo unſpeakably wicked and abuſive, as to beſpit his own Lord and Saviour? Who can but tremble to hear it only? Brethren, conſider here that wonderfull pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of Chriſt, and his truly to be admired ſilence.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They ſmite him on the head with a reed, on that head which all the devils in hell ſhould tremble at, and all the powers of Heaven reverence and which all the Saints do worſhip. I ſay, that everlaſtingly bleſſed head, from which all bleſſing is derived unto us, and doth deſcend upon us. By this ſmiting the prickle of the thorns did more and more pierce the crown of his ſacred head: whence it did ſtill bleed, and the blood guſhed out afreſh, ſo that all his body, neck and face were tinctur'd, and dyed therewith, and by reaſon of the execrable ſpittle of the ſouldiers which was mixed with it, they made his beautifull and lovely face look moſt rufully and like a Leper, according to the Propheſie ſo often already alledged, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>We ſaw him,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>and there was no comlineſs that we ſhould deſire him, he is deſpiſed and rejected of men, and we hid our faces from him, or his face was hid from us.</hi> It was hid indeed becauſe of the tumours, wounds, ſpittle and blood. <hi>Therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>we accounted him as a Leper, and ſtricken and humbled of God.</hi> The ſouldiers then did all theſe things unto him, becauſe the Jews had told them that he did much affect to be a King, and to reign over the Jews.

                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:171778:183"/> This was the ground of all the ſport which they made with the Crown, Clothing, Scepter, and ſcoffing adoration. See here a Spectacle never before in the world, nor never heard of untill now, except that afterwards ſome of the Martyrs ſuffered the like in contempt of Chriſt. Who could have believed theſe things, or who would have dared to preach them, if they had not been written in the Goſpel? But becauſe they are written, we boldy believe and preach them. Who can but tremble to hear theſe things, ſeeing it is moſt certain that we muſt have endured them eternally, (I mean the worm and ſting of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the diriſion of all the creatures, and a final ſeparation from God himſelf) if Chriſt had not voluntarily undergone them for us? This grain of wheat was thus to be multiplied, it is ſown in moſt abominable contempt, that it might ſprout and grow up moſt wonderfully unto Glory. Thus the Kingdom which was not of this world, did conquer and overcome the proud world, not by cruelty of battel, but by humility of ſufferings and patience. The tremendous and fearfull power was hid and concealed awhile, that the imitable patience and ſufferings of him might be ſet forth and commended unto us. Mean while what thoſe ſouldiers did in greateſt contempt and cruel mockery, this Chriſt the Power and Wiſdom of God did not only undertake and endure, but took care that it might be done profitably, and with good advantage, which was myſtically thus.</p>
               <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">The Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſenſe.</note> The Purple Robe (which was a ſign of royal Majeſty) did ſignifie that Chriſt having overcome all enemies, to wit, the Devil, Sin, the World, and Hell it ſelf, ſhould ſet all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind at liberty again. Or by the Purple mantle is ſignified the ſervice of love which he performed for us, and to us in his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For Scarlet in grain is of the colour of fire, <hi>which the Lord commanded ſhould be taken for the ſervice of his Tabernacle when it was twice dipt,</hi> Exod. 28.5. <hi>to ſignifie our love to God, and to our Neighbour;</hi> whence it is, that whatſoever we offer by fire, and that will endure the teſt, is well pleaſing in the ſight of God. Now Chriſt out of his exceeding great love to us did drink off the cup of his Paſſion to the bottom. Well therefore might he be clothed with a purple Robe, to expreſs this his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing charity to us, or elſe it was to ſhew that he himſelf was that very ſelf-ſame one ſignified by the red Heifer in the Law,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:171778:183"/> 
                  <hi>whoſe body was commanded to be burnt for a ſin-offering without the camp, and the aſhes thereof to be ſprickled upon the people in water,</hi> Numb. 19.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The crown of Thorns ſignified that the Kingdom of Chriſt is not of this world: that is, it doth not glitter with ſtatelineſs or pomp, nor doth it conſiſt of outward force and might, but it is thorny and of a ſcarlet dye: that is, it is ſubject to ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and afflictions. The crowns of the Kings of this world are made part of Iron, part of Silver, and part of Gold: inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating that the Empire of this world conſiſteth in carnal power, luſtre, and nobleneſs. But Chriſts crown is made of Thorns, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hinting unto us, that the Kingdom of Chriſt doth conſiſt, and is full of Thorns and Afflictions. Such a King as Chriſt is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſuch Kings doth he make us, obnoxions to all tribulations. If then thou wouldſt raign with Chriſt, do not ſtartle at, or throw aſide the thorny Crown; for if thou art crowned here with him with thorns, hereafter thou ſhalt be crowned with him with a crown of Glory and honour, <hi>Pſal</hi> 8. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Reed in his hand ſignified, that he had power to lay down his life, and to take it up again, <hi>Iohn</hi> 10. Although they thought no ſuch thing. Seeing Chriſts Kingdom is ſuch a one as grows up among Thorns, no marvell that the world doth ſo ſcoff and jeer at it.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.</note> For the Goſpel and the preaching of the Croſs is fooliſhneſs to the world. When they heard ſay that Chriſt was a King, but ſeeing him crowned with Thorns, they diſdained and made light of him: hearing that the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth freedom from all evil, and ſeeing it come along accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with nothing but the croſs, they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

Chriſtians therefore do look like fools to the world, becauſe they hope for ayd and deliverance, but for all that are at preſent overwhelmed with all manner of miſeries. Hence it was that <hi>Iobs</hi> Wife ſaid to him: <hi>Doſt thou ſtill retain thine integrity? Curſe God, and dye,</hi> Job 2. But however the croſs and afflictions cruſh Chriſt, he is nevertheleſs, and will be a King with all Saints, which will appear to be ſo one day, whether the world will believe it now or no. It follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">John 19.4.</note>Pilate <hi>therefore went forth again, and ſaith unto them, Behold,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:171778:184"/> I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find no fault in him. Then came Jeſus forth, wearing the Crown of Thorns, and the Purple Robe: and</hi> Pilate <hi>ſaith unto them, behold the man. When the chief Prieſts therefore, and the Officers ſaw him, they cryed out, ſaying, Crucifie him, Crucifie him.</hi> Pilate <hi>ſaith unto them, take ye him, and crucifie him: for I find no fault in him. The</hi> Jews
<hi>anſwered him, we have a law, and by our law he ought to dye, becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God. When</hi> Pilate <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heard that ſaying, he was the more afraid, and went again into the Judgement Hall, and ſaith unto Jeſus, Whence art thou? But Jeſus gave him no anſwer. Then</hi> Pilate <hi>ſaith unto him, ſpeakeſt thou not unto me? Knoweſt thou not that I have power to crucifie thee, and have power to releaſe thee? Jeſus anſwered, Thou could<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt have no power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater ſin. And from thenceforth</hi> Pilate <hi>ſought to releaſe him: (But the</hi> Jews <hi>cryed out, ſaying, if thou let this man go, thou art not</hi> Caeſars <hi>friend: whoſoever maketh himſelf a King ſpeaketh againſt</hi> Caeſar.</p>
               <p>'Tis not to be uttered what the malice of the <hi>Jews</hi> plotted againſt Chriſt, how earneſtly they did preſs and urge againſt him, what various and ſeveral things they invented to crucifie an innocent Chriſt. As for any thing concerning the civil Laws, Chriſt ought to have been ſet at liberty, inaſmuch as the Judge was ſatisfied in his opinion, and the civil Laws do appoint but one puniſhment for one offence. But thus Chriſt and they that are his do ſpeed in this world, they can ſcarcely find civil honeſt Judges. Chriſt ought to have been abſolved by the Judges ſentence, foraſmuch as he had now ſuffered the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment pronounced againſt him. But wickedneſs is ſo inſatiable, that it will not be ſatisfied when puniſhment is inflicted, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Judge himſelf doth omit nothing that might tend to Chriſts liberty, but doth uſe his utmoſt endeavour to effect it, excepting only this, that in the end he doth ſuffer himſelf to be preſt to do open injuſtice for fear of his Superiours. How much had he done, and ſtood hitherto on the behalf of Chriſt? How many conſultations had he, and how did he debate the buſineſs in his behalf? But all his art and skill neither could nor ought to take place: for God had otherwiſe determined. Indeed <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> doth now openly and ſharply ſpeak to the <hi>Jews,</hi> endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:171778:184"/> what poſſibly he could to maintain what was juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt: And then he examineth Jeſus in private, that he might find out the truth of the mattter; but all that he attempted was to no purpoſe. Now when his ſervants had moſt miſerably and moſt ſhamefully abuſed and made ſport with Jeſus, he offers to ſhew him to the people in that pittifull pickle and deformity, if thereby happily he might move them to ſome compaſſion. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> therefore went out again, but not altogether ſo hot and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to do him right, as when he went out before. He had not a little ſwerved from the right Rule of true Juſtice when he did but ſcourge innocent Jeſus. Now he brings him out again, and ſets Chriſt before them, that ye may know, ſaid he, that I find no fault at all in him. He doth here again acknowledge that Chriſt was innocent, and that it was plain injuſtice to proceed any further againſt him; Nay, he doth clearly confeſs that he had gone beyond his bounds, and had done more then he could anſwer in ſcourging him. For if the Judge could find no fault in him, ſurely he muſt needs be whipt unjuſtly. Here then was fulfilled that of the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Thou haſt tryed me, and ſhalt find nothing,</hi> Pſalm 17.3. Whence it is that Chriſt ſaid at Supper,
<hi>The Prince of this world cometh, and hath nothing in me,</hi> Iohn 14.30. Jeſus therefore went forth, wearing the crown of Thorns and the purple Robe. He went forth without any Imperial ſplendor, but full of reproach. He went forth indeed without any form or comlineſs; for what comlineſs was it for the Son of God to be crowned with thorns, and to be mocked, weltring in his own blood, and expoſed as a gazing-ſtock to his enemies? Who would have believed that this was the Son of God? But this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Chriſt is full of conſolation unto us. For hence we are aſſured that he made ſatisfaction to the utmoſt for us. What could not ſo great humiliation of his Son merit for us, it being voluntarily undertaken for us? Go forth alſo, O ye Daughters of <hi>Sion,</hi> ye believing ſouls, and behold King
<hi>Solomon,</hi> the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making King, who reconcileth all things that are in Heaven, and that are in Earth, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. Behold, I ſay, your King with a crown of thorns, a crown of grief and miſery, with a ludibrious Robe and reproaches, wherewith his mother crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; yet not his mother, but his ſtep-mother the wicked Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue. Here is truly a moſt wonderfull ſpectacle indeed to
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:171778:185"/> be ſeen. He that goeth forth, hath indeed ſome likeneſs of a King, yet is he over-loaden with the confuſion of a moſt deſpicable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: he went along crowned, but his crown was his torture, wounding his glorious Head with a thouſand prickles. He is cloathed in Royal Purple, not for honour, but diſgrace. He bears a Scepter in his hand, but is ſmitten with it on his head. They wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and bow the knee to him, and cry him up for a King, but preſently chaſe him to the Croſs. Think upon theſe things, O Chriſtian; look on Chriſt in this hue, and never deſpair of his Grace and Favour. For doubtleſs as long as thou doſt truſt in him, he will never forſake thee, who hath already ſuffered ſo much for thee, that didſt not deſerve the ſame at his hands. To this end therefore is Chriſt held forth and ſet before thy eyes, that thou ſhouldeſt not deſpair. Whenſoever therefore thou art in any tribulation either of body, or conſcience, or mind, look this way, turn thine eyes toward Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pilate,</hi> the better to aſſwage theſe ſavage beaſts, and move them to ſome pity, knowing what compaſſion there is in nature, whereby as every creature loves its like, ſo alſo doth every one naturally take compaſſion on its like. Therefore he cryes out to them with a loud voyce: <hi>Behold the man,</hi> as if he had ſaid, O ye Jews, be ſatisfied with the ſcourging of this man, which yet I was forced to inflict rather out of neceſſity, then any offence of his. Behold what a man ye have made of him, ſee how he is uſed, mark if he doth look but like a man. The ſight of him is enough to melt and break an iron or flinty heart. Ye ſee there is no whole skin left in all his body from top to toe. No part or member of his body is free; ye ſee nothing but wounds and gore blood all over him. Have compaſſion therefore and take ſome pity upon him, for he is not a dog, but a man, as ye are, although indeed he hath been uſed worſe then one would uſe a dog. Let this puniſhment ſuffice, be ye ſatisfied with what he hath ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed already, and lets diſmiſs him and ſend him going. For if he hath formerly erred in matter of Faith, this whipping will be a perpetual warning to him, that he never more broach the like er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours again. If ye envy him as King, yet forbear, for ye ſee him abaſed and dejected; the name of King is vaniſht from him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the baſeſt penance and higheſt mulct that can be exacted, he
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:171778:185"/> hath been whipt, crowned with Thorns, put into a mock-habit, ſcorned with bitter revilings, beaten and buffeted ſufficiently: let his ſhame abound, and let your envy abate. All this
<hi>Pilate</hi> ſpake very civilly indeed and religiouſly unto them, but to little or no purpoſe with theſe men.</p>
               <p>Moſt truly doth he ſay, <hi>Behold the man.</hi> Hearken Hereticks, ye that deny the Humanity of Chriſt. <hi>Behold the Man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</hi> Hear this, O Chriſtian; what did <hi>Pilate</hi> here ſee but a man? If thou canſt not ſee God, yet behold this man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo deſpicable for thy ſake. Hear it too thou ſinner, <hi>Behold the man.</hi> See what man merited, ſee how miſerable man is made, ſee what God-man ſuffered for thee, that thou be not found un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfull. Take heed thou be not like the <hi>Iews,</hi> who were more enraged at that miſerable Spectacle of Chriſt; and that whereby they ſhould have been moved to compaſſion, therewith was their wrath and malice more enflamed. They cry out, <hi>Crucifie him, Crucifie him,</hi> q.d. proceed and go on as thou haſt begun. If thou haſt ſcourged him, crucifie alſo. Tis not enough to have him whipt, we are not contented with that, we long to ſee him dying upon the Croſs. Thou doſt ſhew us his wounds, but we muſt have his life too. We ſhall never be at quiet till we ſee him dead. He ſhall never ſcape alive out of our hands, though it coſt us all that ever we have. It ſhall be ſo, thou curſed, cruell, wicked <hi>Jew.</hi> It ſhall be as thou ſayeſt, but not becauſe thou wouldeſt have it ſo, but becauſe God hath ſo diſpoſed it: Thou ſhalt ſee him on the Croſs, and there dying too. But it had been better for thee to have ſuffered him to preach in the Temple, and that <hi>Barabbas</hi> had been hanged on the gallows. The <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> doth juſtly tax their impiety; ſaying,</p>
               <p n="1">1. When they ſaw him, they cryed out. Therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not excuſe their ſin. <hi>For they have ſeen,</hi> ſaith Chriſt,
<hi>and yet have hated both me and the Father,</hi> Joh. 15.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Thoſe wicked Blaſphemers of Chriſts Paſſion are here taxed, who have ſeen, and do ſee, know, and confeſs, that Chriſt did ſuffer all theſe things for us, and yet will not ceaſe ſtill to blaſpheme.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is ſpoken Emphatically, that <hi>the chief Prieſts did cry out,</hi> for happily the reſt of the multitude might be moved with ſome natural pity and piety, and begin to think upon the Miracles
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:171778:186"/> which he wrought among them, and ſo might be a little aſhamed of what was ſo wickedly done unto Chriſt. The chief Prieſts therefore at leaſt with their Officers cry out. Servants are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded to do as their Maſters do, ſuppoſing that they ſhall be excuſed, if they do but imitate their Lords. In theſe High Prieſts was fulfilled that of <hi>Jeremy, The Paſtors are become bruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and have not ſought the Lord: therefore they ſhall not proſper, and all the flocks ſhall be ſcattered,</hi> Jer. 10. Becauſe the Flock, that is, the people were not only not brought to the Knowledge of Chriſt, but withall were ſtirred up to ſeek his death, therefore they fell into the pit and periſhed. But all the fault was in their Leaders and Governours. <hi>Pilate</hi> took nothing more hainouſly at their hands then this obſtinate envy of the <hi>Jews.</hi> Therefore when he ſaw there was no hope to do any good by fair means, he doth try to reſtrain their fury with big words and ſharp threatnings: <hi>Take ye him,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and do you crucifie him,</hi> q.d. Shall I, O ye bloody men, who are more cruel then any bruit beaſts, and becauſe ye envy the <hi>Roman</hi> Laws, ſhall I kill and cut off the innocent? Do you think to affright me with your clamorous out-cryes, and make me act the part of a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer? I am a Miniſter of Law and Juſtice; I am not to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or vindicate the ſpleen and envy of others, but to puniſh Offenders by my Authority: I am no Executioner to torment the innocent. I have hitherto yielded to your hatred, I will no longer be perſwaded by you to exerciſe any more cruelty againſt the innocent. Amongſt all our Lawyers I can find no ſuch Law, that doth command to put any man to death who hath not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it. And therefore if it be ſo capital a crime, and ſuch an high offence with you to be innocent, and if you have any ſuch Law among you, that puniſheth the guiltleſs with death, do you execute them your ſelves: I cannot, nor will I conſent to this fool-hardineſs and groſs indiſcretion. I don't intend to defile my Hall, which is the <hi>Roman</hi> Court and Empire in this place, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood. Take ye him at your own perill, and lead him away, and do you crucifie him, if ye think it beſt. I do not uſe to crucifie any but Malefactors and naughty fellows. But as for this man, I can find in him no crime worthy of the Croſs. This Sentence of <hi>Pilate</hi> were much to be commended indeed, if he had perſevered and continued in his reſolution. But
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:171778:186"/> we ſhall quickly ſee the wind turned, and hear other things of him.</p>
               <p>For all this the <hi>Jews</hi> never ſo much as bluſh at the Juſtice of this Heathen man. Nay when they heard the Judge favour and defend Jeſus with ſuch diligence and induſtry, they verily thought that one way or other Jeſus would ſlip from them, and get out of their hands: and therefore they forge another new crime againſt him, which, to a Judge that was not verſed in their Laws, might ſeem to be a moſt notorious offence.
<hi>We have a Law,</hi> ſay they, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> True, you have a Law, but none of you keepeth the Law: as Chriſt did moſt truly and juſtly upbraid you, <hi>John</hi> 7.19. Thus the greateſt Tranſgreſſours of the Law do moſt cry up and make their boaſt of the Law. But what is it that ye alledge againſt Chriſt out of your Law? <hi>By the Law,</hi> ſay they, <hi>he ought to dye.</hi> And wherefore, I pray, for what cauſe? Becauſe he made himſelf the Son of God. But whats become of your former Accuſation, that he ſhould ſay he was King of the <hi>Jews?</hi> They were found lyers in the firſt, therefore now they invent a new charge againſt him. And what great crime had it been if Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> did ſay that he was the Son of God? If he did the works, why might he not profeſs the Name of God? It was extream hatred in them to accuſe him with ſuch a clamour and noyſe of words, becauſe he only ſaid that he was the Son of God. They ſpeak not a word all this while of thoſe Divine Works which he did, and whereby he proved himſelf to be the Son of God. And they tell a lye too in ſaying, that he made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the Son of God. For he did not glorifie himſelf, that he might be made High Prieſt: Nor did he think it any Robbery for him to be equal with God, but the Father glorified him. <hi>The Lord,</hi> ſaith
<hi>David, ſaid unto my Lord, ſit thou on my right hand untill,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.44. See here alſo how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and envy doth diſagree with it ſelf. They had ſaid before, <hi>It is not lawfull for us to put any man to death.</hi> But now they ſay, we have a Law, and by our Law he ought to dye. So forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and ignorant is envy, that it can neither tell what it did ſay, or what it ſhould ſay. the Law which they alledge muſt either be that of putting a blaſphemer to death,
<hi>Levit.</hi> 24. or that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a falſe Prophet ſeducing the people by lying ſigns and wonders from the worſhip of the one and true God,
<hi>Dent.</hi> 18.

                  <pb n="298" facs="tcp:171778:188"/> But neither of theſe Laws take hold of Chriſt. For he was neither a blaſphemer, nor a falſe Prophet. Therefore it was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to alledge that Law which was for the putting of a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or a falſe Prophet to death, but they were to prove that Chriſt was ſuch a one, for otherwiſe he would truly and fully clear and quit himſelf from both Imputations.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Jews</hi> thought that <hi>Pilate</hi> would preſently pronounce Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death aſſoon as ever he heard but this one crime charged upon Chriſt: but it fell out far otherwiſe. For when he heard this ſaying he was the more afraid. For he thought thus with himſelf, Who knows who or what this man is? For certainly none can make himſelf the Son of God, unleſs firſt he were ſo. And if he be the Son of God, ſurely tis not lawfull for me to paſs ſentence of death upon him. Therefore of neceſſity I muſt ſift out this matter more narrowly yet. Wherefore he brought the Lord of Majeſty into the Judgement Hall again to enquire further of this thing. Here then we ſee,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That even a Heathen Judge gave more honour to the Name of God, then the <hi>Jews</hi> who made their boaſt of God, as doth here plainly appear by <hi>Pilate,</hi> who if not really and in Truth, yet was at leaſt civilly juſt and honeſt, and if not religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, yet did he morally fear and reverence his Gods, as many honeſt and harmleſs men do, who are of opinion that there is a God, but have no true and right faith in him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But obſerve that <hi>Pilate</hi> was afraid indeed, yet did he not repent. Whence tis plain that his fear was ſervile, not filiall and proceeding from Faith: he was afraid leſt he had done too much in ſcourging the Son of God. For he believed as the <hi>Gentiles</hi> do, that the Gods deſcended from heaven, and aſcended thither again, as the Poets fain of <hi>Jupiter, Mercury,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore that he might not ſeem to be ſo wicked againſt his Gods, as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the ſon of
<hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Vulcan,</hi> he doth narrowly pry into the truth of the buſineſs, and asketh, <hi>Whence art thou?</hi> He beats about the buſh, and queſtions him afar off, to fiſh out the truth. But Chriſt makes him no anſwer. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It was nothing either to <hi>Caeſar</hi> or to
<hi>Pilate,</hi> whether he were the Son of God or no. For whereas they accuſed him of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he was cleared and quitted of that charge already.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He did ask it too unſeaſonably. For then was the time for Chriſt to keep ſilence.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:171778:188"/> 3. <hi>Pilate</hi> was now unworthy to hear it, having torn off the wool of the Lamb of God by whipping him, and polluted his hands with his innocent blood.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt doth here hold his peace, becauſe he had told them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten enough before, <hi>that he was not of this world,</hi> Joh.
19.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He alſo told <hi>Pilate,</hi> that they only who were of the Truth could hear his Voyce. Now he knew that <hi>Pilate</hi> was not of the Truth, nor did he ask that queſtion in love to the Truth, but only out of fear of ſome ſhrewd turn or Temporal loſs that might befall him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt doth hold his peace, that he might not ſeem to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour an eſcape, and ſo be unwilling to ſuffer and go thorow his Paſſion. And therefore,</p>
               <p n="7">7. He would do nothing, nor ſay any thing that might hinder his ſuffering. This is that ſilence of which <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>He is brought as a Lamb to the ſlaughter, and as a ſheep before her ſhea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers is dumb, ſo he openeth not his mouth,</hi> Iſa. 53. And <hi>David</hi> in his perſon ſaith: <hi>I was dumb with ſilence, I held my peace even from good,</hi> Pſalm 39. By this his ſilence Chriſt taught us:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That all the Learning and Education in the world is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worth, if it be not employed in love to godlineſs, but either out of a vain affectation, or fear of puniſhment; therefore he gave no anſwer before unto <hi>Herod,</hi> who asked him out of curioſity; nor now unto
<hi>Pilate,</hi> who asked him out of fear. Juſt ſo do many men run after Sermons, ſome out of vain glory, others for fear of Hell, but very few in love to Righteouſneſs and Truth. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt ſort of theſe ſhall be deprived of their hope, for let them hear the Word never ſo greedily, God will not anſwer them. Nor ſhall the ſecond eſcape damnation. For that which the wicked feareth ſhall come upon him. The laſt only ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their deſire. <hi>For bleſſed are they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs,</hi> Mat. 5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt doth here teach us ſilence, that we ſhould not be like fools, who multiply words, whereas nature it ſelf teacheth ſilence, having given two ears to man, and but one mouth. Firſt then conſider that an account muſt be given of every idle word at the day of Judgement, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.36. Secondly,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Locutum fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſſe ſaepe me poenituit,</hi> &amp;c.</note> That of the Heathen is to be obſerved: I have often repented, ſaith he, for ſpeaking, but never for my ſilence. Thirdly, That of <hi>James</hi>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:171778:189"/> eſpecially: <hi>He that bridleth not his tongue, this mans Religion is vain,</hi> Jam. 1.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate</hi> being ſomewhat diſpleaſed at Chriſts ſilence, (for he thought he had ſleighted him) ſpeaks to him a little more ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A proud man of all things cannot endure to be ſcorned.
<hi>Speakeſt thou not unto me? Thou,</hi> ſaith he, who art but a vile and mean fellow, to me who am in higheſt Power and Authority? If he had known the perſon of Chriſt who he was, he would have ſpoken a little more mannerly and modeſtly to him. But the world deſpiſeth all thoſe who carry no great port and pomp out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly. And the men of this world who are proud, and preſume upon their power and riches, do ſcorn and contemn all others in compariſon of themſelves.</p>
               <p n="1">1. And whereas <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaith further to him.
<hi>Knoweſt thou not that I have power to releaſe thee, and to crucifie thee?</hi> It is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a wicked Magiſtrate, who thinks he may lawfully do what he pleaſeth.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>Pilate</hi> here is clearly manifeſt what the diſpoſition and nature of humane Reaſon is in the gifts of God. For he that is more then ordinarily endowed with the gifts of God, and yet hath not faith: he doth not acknowledge them as Gods gifts, but as his own deſerts. And ſo he thinks he may do what he liſteth with them. But Faith teacheth, that the gifts which God beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on a man, are not to make him a Lord, but a Servant, and a Miniſter to improve them: and the greater gifts any man hath received, the more induſtrious and laborious ſhould he be. Hence ſaith Chriſt, <hi>The Princes of the</hi> Gentiles <hi>exerciſe dominion over them;</hi> they are proud of their power, and abuſe it at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure:
<hi>but it ſhall not be ſo among you: but whoſoever will be great among you, let him be your Miniſter,</hi> &amp;c. Mat. 20. Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy therefore or Power, is the gift of God: but if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer'd upon wicked men, they do but Arrogate to themſelves ſomething of Law and right in or by that gift. And if a good man hath this gift beſtowed upon him, he doth acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo much the more a Servant, by how much the greater his gift is that he hath received. <hi>Pilate</hi> was ignorant of this. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpake ſo proudly of his power. But by this his vaunting he condemned himſelf both before God and before men. Out of his own mouth is this evil Servant to be condemned, becauſe
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:171778:189"/> when (by his own confeſſion) he might have acquitted the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and juſt one, yet he choſe rather to condemn him, and to crucifie him. But have a little patience <hi>Pilate,</hi> and he will ſpeak to thee hereafter, and tell thee whence he is. The Lord, I ſay, who is now weak and held priſoner under thy power at preſent, he ſhall go forth as a ſtrong man, he ſhall lift up his voyce and cry: <hi>I held my peace, I alway kept ſilence.</hi> But muſt I ſtill be dumb, and never ſpeak? Yea I will ſpeak as a woman in travel. Then ſhall he ſpeak to thee in his anger, telling thee plainly what thou now askeſt of him. <hi>He hath made me King in</hi> Sion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Pſalm 2.</p>
               <p>But Chriſt cannot forbear to reprove that ſo proud preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Pilate,</hi> and to check his Arrogant boldneſs, leſt by his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ilence he ſhould ſeem to acknowledge and grant what <hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid to be true, that he was at his own diſpoſe and might do with men as he ſaw good. Chriſt cannot bear blaſphemy or impiety. <hi>Pilate</hi> did uſurp and attribute to himſelf that which belonged to God. For God the Father was the chief Author of Chriſts ſuffering. But <hi>Pilate</hi> claimed this power to himſelf.
<hi>I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>can crucifie thee.</hi> Chriſt can no longer endure to hear this blaſphemy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. <hi>Thou couldeſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>have no power againſt me,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>q.d.</hi> Shouldeſt thou, or any man elſe have power over the Son of God? No ſuch matter. Thou with thy whole Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary force and all the
<hi>Jews</hi> together couldſt not touch ſo much as an hair of my head, if the Counſell and Will of my Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had not determined that I ſhould ſuffer. Wherefore thou haſt no power from <hi>Caeſar,</hi> nor from thoſe who by their great exclamation ſtrengthen thine arm againſt me, but from him that is above all, is this power given thee over me. Who foretold it by the Prophet long ſince: <hi>Awake, O ſword, againſt my Shepheard, and againſt the man that is my Fellow, ſmite the Shepheard,</hi> &amp;c. Zach. 13. And if he did not hold my right hand, and diſpoſe of me at his pleaſure, I could break thee as a Potters veſſel with the Rod only of my mouth, or with one beck or twinkling of mine eye. Therefore becauſe I am delivered into thy hands from above (for the Father hath delivered me, and hath not ſpared his own Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8) do not thou glory and boaſt ſo: for tis not thy power, but Gods permiſſion. Beſides, it is no true power which thou doſt exerciſe over me, but Tyranny and Robbery,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:171778:190"/> Power is given for the praiſe and protection of them that do well, and for the puniſhment of evil doers,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 13. Thou haſt received power, yet tis not lawfull for thee to uſe it as thou liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. For as the Law is given or made for the lawleſs and ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly only, (1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.) So the Magiſtrate hath right to uſe the Sword only againſt the wicked. Now if he deſtroy the guiltleſs with the Sword, it is no lawfull power, but Tyranny: it is Theft, not Magiſtracy. Whereas thou art let alone to abuſe thy power, do not brag and make thy boaſt of that, for the Lord will not ſuffer the <hi>Rod of the wicked to reſt upon the Lot of the Righteous,</hi> Pſal. 125. <hi>Shall the Ax boaſt it ſelf againſt him that heweth therewith? Iſa.</hi> 10. A Thief hath no power over a true man, no Law againſt an honeſt man: yet he may lay wait for him, fall upon him, and kill him. So thou haſt no more power over me, but by permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of my Father. Hereby,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt doth quell <hi>Pilate,</hi> who boaſted ſo much of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but abuſed the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth ſhew him, that he did not ſuffer unwillingly, nor was he compel'd to the Croſs by mans power, but his Fathers pleaſure.</p>
               <p n="3">3. He warneth all Judges, that they do not proudly vaunt of their power. Alſo that they ſhould conſider and know themſelves to be but Judges, not Tyrants; And that they do not bear the Sword againſt the godly, but againſt the wicked doers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But eſpecially he doth hereby comfort the godly, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their conſciences, letting them know that the Kingdom of the world can do nothing againſt them, but what the Father of his good pleaſure alloweth, to give them experience of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and aſſiſtance, and to ſtrengthen their Faith. Therefore he ſaith, <hi>I will be a wall of fire,</hi> Zach. 2. But Chriſt tells him fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath the greater ſin,</hi> q.d. Thou haſt no power to crucifie me, but thou haſt much ſin in ſo doing: but yet
<hi>Judas</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> have more ſin then thou haſt. For it was he and they that laid hands on me, and falſly accuſed me. What they do is out of envy: but what thou doſt is for fear, yet not without ſin. Tis true, thou art a friend to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, but the baſeneſs of the
<hi>Iews</hi> carry thee captive another way. They have the Law, and do not ignorantly, but wittingly abuſe the permiſſion of God: but thou never hadſt that Law;
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:171778:190"/> and therefore tis not ſo much folly and malignity in thee to hate the Wiſdom, or be ignorant of the Sacraments of God. Thou committeſt murther in ſhedding the blood of a man thou doſt not know: but they by delivering their King and Lord to death, do add Sacriledge to their Murder. Where we ſee that one ſin is greater then another: ſins of knowledge are greater then ſins of ignorance: So he that ſinneth maliciouſly doth offend more then he that ſinneth out of infirmity. And a wicked Counſellour doth ſin more then an ignorant Prince or Judge. A naughty Chriſtian doth ſin more then an Heathen, and more grievouſly in the ſame kind of ſin.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate</hi> being troubled at theſe words of Chriſt, doth labour yet more earneſtly to ſet Chriſt at liberty. For although he was a Heathen, yet he was troubled at the denunciation againſt ſin, nor would he willingly ſin againſt God, although he knew him not, no more then the Heathen could know him, to wit, <hi>by the things that are made,</hi> Rom.
1.</p>
               <p>Now when the <hi>Jews</hi> perceived that <hi>Pilate</hi> was afraid leſt he ſhould offend God, and polluet himſelf with ſin, they recur to the former cavil, that he affected and deſired a Kingdom; that he would fain be King and ſupplant <hi>Caeſar,</hi> which they ſhew was not ſafe for him being Judge and Vice-roy to neglect; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they threaten him with <hi>Caeſar:</hi> that which doth moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and compell wicked Judges. <hi>If thou let this man go,</hi> ſay they,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> q.d. If it doth not concern thee, that he hath ſinned againſt God: yet doubtleſs it is ſomething to thee, that he hath offended againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Thou art a <hi>Royaliſt,</hi> a
<hi>Caeſarian,</hi> and doſt reſide here to the end thou mayeſt not diminiſh, but defend and encreaſe the Name, Honour, Renown, and Power of
<hi>Caeſar.</hi> But this man doth directly ſet himſelf againſt
<hi>Caeſar.</hi> For <hi>Caeſars</hi> main drift is to be King of
<hi>Syria,</hi> eſpecially over us <hi>Jews,</hi> where thou, O
<hi>Pilate</hi> doſt preſide and command in the Name of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> Therefore if thou ſhouldeſt let this fellow eſcape, and not puniſh this his affectation to be a King, none could think otherwiſe but that thou thy ſelf alſo waſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> back-friend, in that thou doſt not puniſh his open enemy. For whoſoever maketh himſelf a King ſpeaketh againſt <hi>Caeſar.</hi> All this they ſaid, not for any love to
<hi>Caeſar,</hi> for they hated him to the death, and had often made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections againſt him: but out of hatred to Chriſt, only colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:171778:191"/> it over with the pretence of
<hi>Caeſars</hi> Name and Honour, that they might ſatisfie their luſts upon Chriſt. This is the Weapon that wounded <hi>Pilates</hi> Juſtice, with this Exclamation his conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy doth flag and ſhatter in pieces; his juſtice is turned into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, and all the reaſon and gravity of this man falls to the ground. So that here it is plain, that civil Righteouſneſs is not able to hold out a true and full Tryal, and ſo is nothing worth unleſs it ſtood it out to the utmoſt. Thus we are now come to an end of that long Diſpute of <hi>Pilate,</hi> both with Chriſt and with the
<hi>Jews,</hi> which did wholly tend to the freeing of the innocent: It follows therefore:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> Pilate <hi>therefore heard that ſaying,
<note place="margin">John 19.13.</note> he brought Jeſus forth, and ſat down in the Judgement ſeat, in a place that is called the</hi> Pavement, <hi>but in the Hebrew</hi> Gabbatha. <hi>And it was the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Paſsover, about the ſixth hour: and he ſaith unto the</hi> Jews,
<hi>behold your King. But they cryed out, Away with him, away with him, crucifie him.</hi> Pilate <hi>ſaith unto them, ſhall I crucifie your King? The chief Prieſts anſwered, We have no King but</hi> Caeſar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When he was ſet down on the Judgement ſeat,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.19.</note> his Wife ſent us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, ſaying, Have thou nothing to do with that juſt man: for I have ſuffered many things in a dream this day, becauſe of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>When</hi> Pilate <hi>ſaw that he could prevail nothing,
<note place="margin">verſe 24.</note> but that rather a tumult was made, willing to content the people,</hi> Mark 15.15. <hi>gave ſentence that it ſhould be as they required,</hi> Luke 23.24. <hi>He took water and waſhed his hands before the multitude, ſaying, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent of the blood of this juſt perſon, ſee ye to it. Then anſwered all the people, and ſaid, His blood be on us, and on our children. Then releaſed he</hi> Barabbas <hi>unto them, who for ſedition and murder was caſt into priſon, whom they had deſired, but he delivered Jeſus to their will,</hi> Luke
23.25. <hi>When he had ſcourged him,</hi> Mat. 27.26. <hi>and mocked him,</hi> ver. 31. <hi>to be crucified.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Behold, dear Brethren, how the Devil prevailed, firſt in
<hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> then in the <hi>Jews,</hi> and laſtly in <hi>Pilate</hi> alſo: he is greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate to bring the buſineſs to an iſſue; but he little thought that he ſhould have the worſt of it in the end. The Judge then ſits upon the Bench ready to Judge him, whom God the Father had appointed to be Judge of the quick and of the dead,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:171778:191"/> 
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. And albeit
<hi>Pilate</hi> well knew that all meances were to no purpoſe, and what was this way attempted, was but in vain: yet becauſe he ſaw (firſt) the implacable malice of the <hi>Jews</hi> againſt Jeſus, and (ſecondly) the ſtrange conſent of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Princes for the ruin of one man: withall (thirdly) ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt himſelf, that although he was harmleſs indeed &amp; inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, yet he was a mean man, and of a ſlender eſtate, and did not much plead for himſelf: but (fourthly) this ſtuck much in his ſtomack, that many, though falſly accuſed to <hi>Caeſar</hi> thorow envy and malice, were yet much in danger to loſe their places: and (fiſthly) he thought that he had now done enough, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently endeavoured himſelf againſt all the confederates of the whole Nation that had conſpired his death, and that he had put forth his utmoſt in defence of the innocency of innocent Chriſt, therefore he now reſolved to ſerve their turn, and yield to their hatred. So that <hi>Pilate</hi> was ſeduced by the Favour and generall Vote and conſent of the people; the contemp and meanneſs of Chriſt, and the fear of <hi>Caeſar.</hi> He gets upon the Bench again, not regarding Law now, nor conſidering that he had ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Chriſt innocent. What right Judgement can be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when the Judges breaſt lyes open to the paſſions of hatred, covetouſneſs, and the fear of man? <hi>Pilate</hi> was afraid leſt he ſhould be falſly traduced to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as one that favoured <hi>Caeſars</hi> enemy, and for that cauſe ſhould be thrown out of his Office and place of a Magiſtrate. But what the wicked feareth, that doth come upon him. For afterwards he was thrown out of his praefectureſhip, and baniſhed, as
<hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith, <hi>lib.</hi> 18. <hi>c.</hi> 7. and ſo miſerably was he tortured, that he killed himſelf with his own hands, and violently caſt away his abominable and filthy life, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> witneſſeth in his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory,</hi> lib. 7. c. 8. Thus the Judgement of the Lord, though it tarry a while, yet is it not quite taken away.</p>
               <p>But <hi>John</hi> doth not only deſcribe the Judgement, but withall the Tribunal and place of Judgement; as alſo the day and hour, that the Hiſtory might have the greater crrdit both with thoſe that knew the proceedings, and with thoſe that were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with them. He expreſly nameth the place both in Greek and Hebrew: for
<hi>Lythoſtrotos</hi> (the <hi>Pavement</hi>) is a Greek word, and
<hi>Gabbatha</hi> is an Hebrew word. Yet theſe two words
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:171778:192"/> do not ſignifie the ſame thing.
<hi>Lythoſtrotos</hi> is a Cauſey or Pavement, a place pitch'd or laid with ſtone: but <hi>Gabbatha</hi> is as much as to ſay, a High or Eminent place, ſo called either from the Height and Aſcent of it, or becauſe a Judge ſhould ſit in an high place above the reſt in the Court; that is, he ought to have his mind raiſed unto God, and lifted up to him on high, that he may ſo judge others, even as he himſelf would be judged of God.</p>
               <p>The Day when Chriſt was ſentenced to death, <hi>John</hi> calls it the preparation of the Paſsover. The Day when theſe things were done was the very Feaſt of the Paſsover, as we have proved in the entrance to this Diſcourſe. And it is called <hi>the Preparation,</hi> becauſe of the Sabbath which alwayes followed, in which it was not lawfull for the
<hi>Jews</hi> to dreſs any meat, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23. But in other Feaſts they might, even on the Feaſt of the Paſsover. This Day then was both a feſtival in it ſelf, as alſo a preparation to the following Sabbath: wherefore that year it fell out on the ſixth day of the week, this day therefore was the <hi>Iews</hi> preparation of the Sabbath. But to us it was
<hi>Paraſceve,</hi> and the preparation of Eternal Life, which was prepared for us on that day. Moſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically therefore doth <hi>John</hi> ſo diligently ſet down and name the day of Chriſts death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To ſhew that the work of Redemption was compleated upon that day on which the work of Creation was finiſhed; and that man was Redeemed the ſame in which he was made, to wit, on the ſixth day,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He doth ſo punctually deſcribe this day and hour, as well in reſpect of the Reſurrection, as of the three dayes ſpace in which Chriſt lay in the grave, that the ſaying of our Lord to the
<hi>Iews</hi> might be found true: <hi>As</hi> Jonas, ſaith he, <hi>was three dayes and three nights in the belly of the Whale, ſo ſhall the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 12.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſeem to diſagree about the hour of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith it was the third hour,
<hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith it was the ſixth. However there is no contradiction between them, although the Ancients have taken great pains to reconcile the
<hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and
<hi>Theophylact.</hi> The later of whom is of opinion,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there was a miſtake in the Pen-man, putting one
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:171778:192"/> letter for another. For the
<hi>Greeks</hi> ſignifie their numbers by letters.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaks of the two-fold crucifying of Chriſt; One by the tongues of the Jews, who cryed out,
<hi>Crucifie him:</hi> The other by the hands of the ſouldiers; one was at the third, the other at the ſixth hour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. But this knot may more eaſily be untyed another way: thus. Whereas <hi>Pilate</hi> gave ſentence that Chriſt ſhould be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, this was about the beginning of the third hour, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the ſixth; ſo that the crucifying of Chriſt was begun and ended between the third and ſixth hour. And becauſe theſe two hours comprehended the whole buſineſs of the Croſs, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Mark</hi> nameth one, and
<hi>John</hi> another, as the beginning and end of the crucifying of Chriſt. In ſhort, The crucifying and paſſing ſentence was within three hours, to wit, the third and the ſixth. From the ſixth there was darkneſs till the ninth hour, when Chriſt gave up the Ghoſt. Or thus, It may be collected out of <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. that the whole day was divided into the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Third, Sixth, Ninth, and Evening hour. Whatever was done between the third and ſixth hour, is ſaid to be done at the third hour, becauſe the ſixth was not yet come. <hi>John</hi> therefore doth not ſay, that Chriſt was adjudged to die at the ſixth hour, <hi>but about the ſixth hour,</hi> ſignifying that yet it was the third hour, as <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith it was. But the third was almoſt out, and the ſixth hour now was at hand.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had a far other Computation of their hours than we (<hi>Engliſh,</hi> or) <hi>Germans</hi> have. For then the ſixth hour was about noon. Their day had twelve hours, and the night as many,
<hi>John</hi> 11. But enough of this. Let us return to the Court of Judgement. When <hi>Pilate</hi> ſate on the Judgement ſeat, the place, day and hour aforeſaid, before he would pronounce ſentence, he ſpeaks again to the Jews. For he was very unwilling to paſs ſentence of death: And therefore he delayed, and put it off ſo long, contrary to thoſe who make nothing to ſhed mans blood, <hi>Behold your King,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>whom ye have delivered Priſoner to me under that inditement!</hi> Why are ye ſo implacably bent againſt him? Look upon him! he is whipt, buffeted, mockt, ſpit on, here he ſtands before you full of deriſion and reproach.
<hi>Behold your King,</hi> What hurt hath he done you? What harm
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:171778:193"/> can he do to you? He could not help himſelf, in vain therefore do you fear him. If he did ſay he was a King, ſee now he is brought low enough. If he was indeed your King, loe he is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to Judgement. If he fain would be a King, Behold what a worthy King he is, juſt ſuch a one as Boyes uſe to make. Nay, In this reſpect he is ſo much worſe, in that he hath indured more puniſhment and reproaches. Behold therefore your King, What do you ſee in him? What are you reſolved to do with him? Are ye ſatisfied with what he hath ſuffered? Will ye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt from your wicked intention, leſt you unjuſtly deſtroy him, and conſequently incur your own utter ruine? See here with what unwillingneſs <hi>Pilate</hi> yielded to the rage of the Jews; For although they threatened him with <hi>Caeſars</hi> diſpleaſure, yet he doth try all means, if poſſibly he might, to reſcue and deliver the innocent. Certainly he was more righteous and juſt than many in our times, who rave againſt, and fall foul on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, before they have any command or commiſſion from <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſo to do.</p>
               <p>But 'tis to be obſerved, that Chriſt had three names, and thoſe very eminent and famous too, even from unbelievers. For (Firſt)
<hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid before, <hi>Behold the man.</hi> Now (Secondly) he ſaith, <hi>Behold your King.</hi> The Jews (Thirdly) add, <hi>Behold be made himſelf the Son of God.</hi> Theſe three, a Man, King, God, or the Son of God, are the moſt true names of the one only Chriſt; whom his enemies indeed did ſcoffingly confeſs, but his friends who reverence and truly adore him do ſeriouſly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And in theſe three names, all our faith, hope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort do conſiſt.</p>
               <p>As it is the coſtome of envious men to interrupt ones ſpeech, when any thing is ſpoken which they would not hear of willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it happened to <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 22. When he made his defence, and gave an account of himſelf at <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> So the Jews here interrupt
<hi>Pilates</hi> ſpeech, crying out, <hi>Away with him, away with him, Crucifie him.</hi> Thus he that did ſo mercifully viſit the children of men, he that dealt ſo gently and ſweetly with the weak among them, is grievous to them to behold. They reſt not at once, crying <hi>Away with him;</hi> but they cry out twice, to ſhew their greater diſdain and indignation againſt Chriſt. Although this their bawling rebounded on their own boſom.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:171778:193"/> For their Saviour was taken from them, both in this world, and that which is to come. When thoſe wretched Caytiffs cryed out to have Chriſt taken out of their ſight, they brought this miſery upon themſelves, even to be deprived of their King, Prince and Prieſt. Then was fulfilled that of <hi>Hoſea, The Children of Iſrael ſhall be many days without a King, and without a Prince, and without a Sacrifice,</hi> Hoſ. 3. Again, <hi>They ſhall go with their flocks and with their heards to ſeek the Lord, but they ſhall not find him, he hath withdrawn himſelf from them,</hi> Hoſ. 5. And that juſtly too, becauſe they cryed, <hi>Away with the Saviour, Crucifie the Propitiator;</hi> ſo that they have loſt their ſalvation, and have no defence left them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pilate,</hi> When he heard theſe unclean dogs bark, and theſe cruel Lions roar a freſh, he doth again make mention of their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Shall I crucifie your King?</hi> as if he had ſaid, What ſtrange men are ye, who will needs crucifie your own King? It will be a perpetual blot and ſtain to you. He ſpeaks this more in jeſt, than in earneſt; how be it, be doth ſtill endeavour to break their fury with ſuch kind of Ironies or Riddles. He did yet tremble to ſhed innocent blood. But the Jews were not in jeſt; this was no matter of mirth to them. <hi>We have no King,</hi> ſay they, <hi>but Caeſar, q.d.</hi> Why doſt thou talk ſo much of our King to us? as if we Jews would have a King of our own? We will not be tainted with this ſuſpition. We will not have this man either for a King, or for <hi>Ceaſar.</hi> We are well enough contented with <hi>Tiberius Caeſar.</hi> We acknowledge him for our Soveraign, and do pay toll and tribute to him, as thou <hi>Pilate</hi> doſt very well know. Thus ye miſerable Jews have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed your Meſſias, and rejected him, and have choſen <hi>Caeſar</hi> in his ſtead; whom yet ye ever hated, and have traduced him for a very <hi>Edomite</hi> or <hi>Idumaean.</hi> Him therefore ye ſhall have to be your King, whether ye will or no, and him indeed ye have. This our Jeſus would never have tyrannized over you with ſuch cruelty, as
<hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> have ſince done. But if ye are ſo addicted to the <hi>Roman Caeſar,</hi> why have ye ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled? Why have ye made ſo many mut nies againſt him? But ſuch was their hatred againſt Chriſt, (<hi>Zach.</hi> 9. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.) that out of envy to him they would applaud and commend <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,</hi> whom they did mortally and moſt of all hate.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:171778:194"/> See what malice will do. If they might but deſtroy Chriſt, they would perpetually enſlave themſelves, as if they had ſaid, We had rather be vaſſals to <hi>Ceaſar,</hi> than Free-men under this King. Well then, ye ſhall be his ſlaves, that you may learn the difference between the ſervice of God and the ſervice of men. By theſe words they caſt off both Chriſt and God, both of which are called their King in the Scriptures. They ſay of God, <hi>The Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King,</hi> Iſa. 33.22. And of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> the Scripture ſaith plainly, that he ſhould be King, <hi>Behold thy King cometh to thee meek,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. And again, <hi>I will raiſe unto David a righteous branch, and a King ſhall raign and proſper, &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 23. But here they caſt off both, God and their Meſſias; when they ſay, <hi>We have no King but Caeſar.</hi> Juſtly therefore is it ſaid of them, <hi>The Princes of Iſrael have forſaken me, and I have forſaken you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But whilſt <hi>Pilate</hi> ſat on the Tribunal, his wife ſent to him, ſtraitly charging him that he ſhould not paſs any ſevere ſentence againſt Chriſt, affirming that ſhe had ſuffered many things by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of him. O miracle, ſaith <hi>Theophylact,</hi> he that is judged doth terrifie the Judges wife. What that womans viſion was in her dream of Chriſt, the Evangelifts do not expreſs. Nor can any man poſitively conclude it. But certain it is that this Viſion was not ſhewed to that woman without divine providence. God knows how to pre-ordain and diſpoſe all things better then all the wiſe men in the world can imagine.
<hi>Pilates</hi> wife was in ſome meaſure converted unto Chriſt, and did labour all that poſſibly ſhe could to withdraw her husband, and hinder him from doing any hurt unto Chriſt. Herein doubtleſs ſhe is to be commended above all the Jews, in that ſhe durſt acknowledge Chriſt by his proper Epithite, and pronounce him a juſt man; which was as much as to accuſe all the Jews of a lie and unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. This Viſion was not ſhewed to the man, but to the woman, becauſe happily he was not worthy of it, nor would any have believed him, becauſe he had ſo laboured to ſet Chriſt at liberty.</p>
               <p>Some there are who do attribute all theſe things to the Devil, as he who now laboured might and main by this woman to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Paſſion of our Lord, which before he had endeavoured with all induſtry. For now he perceived that it was himſelf, and
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:171778:194"/> not Chriſt that would be ruined by that Paſſion; which that he might the more ſpeedily prevent and hinder, he makes choiſe of a woman, a very fit and familiar Inſtrument for him by which he might deſtory mankind. But now he had out ſlipt his time, and ſtaid too long; for he had already ſwallowed the hook, <hi>Haman</hi> heretofore was ſtrangled on that Gallows which he had provided for
<hi>Mordecai:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eſth. 7.</note> ſo the devil was deſtroyed upon the Croſs which he had prepared for Chriſt. <hi>For upon the Croſs it was that Chriſt ſpoiled Principalities and Powers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15.</p>
               <p>Thus much concerning <hi>Pilates</hi> wife. But all this while
<hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> was nothing wrought upon, he reſolves to paſs ſentence for all this, for his carnal prudence thought it more ſafe, if he ſerved the common good with the loſs of ones mans life. Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (thought he) is a grievous inconvenience, and of great damage to the Common-wealth; therefore he will pleaſe and ſatisfie the multitude. A Typeof thoſe who will do Juſtice ſo far as the world and the worlds friends will allow of it; they will keep ſo long to the rule of Righteouſneſs, that they will be ſure to loſe nothing of their wealth and honour. However <hi>Pilate</hi> was yet in a great ſtraight. He was willing to gratifie the Jews, but on the other hand, the ſheding of innocent blood did ſtare fearfully in his face. And therefore he doth call for water, and waſh his hands before them all, by which he would ſignifie that he had no hand in ſhedding this innocent blood. And this he did not after the cuſtome of the Gentiles, but of the Jews. For <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency,</hi> Pſalm 26. This <hi>Pilate</hi> would fain imitate; and waſh his hands he did, but not his heart. For the Lord had ſaid before, that he ſinned in what he did, though not ſo much as the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> did.
<hi>I am clear,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>from the blood of this juſt perſon; See ye to it.</hi> I am but the Miniſter of the Law, 'tis your cry hath ſhed the blood, and not I. But thou muſt not think to eſcape ſo, O thou Judge, who muſt alſo thy ſelf be judged, who doſt not judge the cauſe of the poor and fatherleſs, but art daſtardly afraid of the clamours and threats of the baſe people, and ſwerveſt from doing Equity and Right. Knoweſt thou not what courage and conſtancy becomes a Judge, that he ſhould rather die a thouſand deaths, than not do Juſtice? Therefore the wiſe man
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:171778:195"/> ſaith, <hi>Seek not to be Judge, being not able to take away iniquity, leſt at any time thou fear the perſon of the Mighty, and lay a ſtumbling block in the way of thy uprightneſs,</hi> Eccluſ. 7.6. Why doſt thou ſuffer Liers to turn thee from the truth? O thou double tongu'd Judge, who with the ſame mouth doſt three or four times excuſe, and by and by condemn moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly. Thou doſt condemn the innocent, and yet doſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him innocent. Wretched man, who did thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witch thee? Who infected the purity of thy mind? Why doſt thou thus pervert Judgement? Seeſt thou not what enmity thou cauſeſt to the
<hi>Roman</hi> dignity hereby? It is a ſlur to <hi>Ceaſar,</hi> a ſtain to thy Honour and Reputation, thou rendreſt thy ſelf odious and inſamous to all men; finally thou doſt give an ill example to other Judges to do as bad as thou doſt. Haſt forgot what oath thou didſt take? Art not afraid of the wrath of thy Gods? To what purpoſe are the Laws, and the Power, and Authority of Governours, if it be lawfull to do thus? All the Elements may juſtly riſe up and arm themſelves againſt thee, inaſmuch as thou doſt what in thee lies to deſtroy their Maker. What needeſt thou fling all the fault upon the Jews, when thou thy ſelf mightſt have reſcued him? Thou knewſt full well that for envy he was delivered, and it was in thy hand, by thine own confeſſion, to abſolve or condemn him. But he from whom thou hadſt thy power will one day examine thy works, and ſearch out all thy thoughts, becauſe when thou waſt an Officer of his Kingdom, thou didſt not judge juſtly, nor keep the Law of Righteouſneſs, and didſt not walk according to the Will of God. But what do the <hi>Jews</hi> anſwer when they heard <hi>Pilate</hi> caſt all the guilt of Chriſts blood upon them, and lay the ſin at their door? They are not in the leaſt ſtartled, but count it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a trifle, and make light of it. <hi>Let not this,</hi> ſay they,
<hi>trouble or binder thee.</hi> Take thou no further care; Be this Jeſus juſt or unjuſt, let him be good or bad, all the guilt of his death be upon us. We would have the buſineſs diſpatched: We would fain be guilty of his blood. Do thou only give ſentence; <hi>His blood be on us, and on our Children.</hi> O wicked Parents! by this one word they deſtroyed themſelves, and all their poſterity; <hi>A Generation of Vipers indeed,</hi> Mat. 3. Therefore O ye naughty <hi>Jews,</hi> be it unto you as you have ſaid, for in as much as ye have una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:171778:195"/> deſired it, let all the righteous blood that hath been ſhed from the beginning of the world reſt upon you,
<hi>Mat.</hi> 23. <hi>Your hands are defiled with blood, therefore ye pray in vain,</hi> Iſa. 1. <hi>Your houſe ſhall be left deſolate to you and yours: Ye ſhall be Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agates and Vagabonds upon the earth like</hi> Cain,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 4. And no doubt but ye have felt the ſmart of it long ſince, how ſorely this blood of Chriſt hath lain upon you,
<note place="margin">But now 1659. years.</note> and oppreſt you and your Children, now more than theſe fifteen hundred years. Nor ſhall you ever have reſt and quiet, till ye be converted, and turn to him, and acknowledge your iniquity.</p>
               <p>After <hi>Pilate</hi> had waſht his hands, and thought himſelf whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than the ſnow, then he gives ſentence againſt Chriſt to put him to death. He thought it a ſmall matter to adjudge a poor mean man to die: He thought no body would revenge his blood; but he found it otherwiſe at laſt. What matter is it if a godly man hath no man to take his part, or none to revenge his quarrel, ſo long as he hath God to avenge his wrong?
<hi>Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance is mine,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will repay,</hi> Deut. 32. Thus
<hi>Barabbas</hi> the Robber is let go without any puniſhment, but innocent Jeſus is whipt, and judged to death, even the death of the Croſs, <hi>The juſt for the unjnſt.</hi> So thoſe ſons of men, <hi>Whoſe teeth are ſpears and arrows, and their tongue a ſharp ſword,</hi> did prevail and get the day, becauſe they ſtifly ſtood it out, and held on their clamour ſo long, till at laſt he was delivered to them to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. And ſo he that gives life to all, bare the ſentence of death for us. For in the righteous Judgement and Court of God this ſentence of death was due to us: But Chriſt took it upon himſelf. Thus, I ſay, <hi>He to whom the heavenly Father had committed all Judgement,</hi> John 5. <hi>And who ſhall call to the Heavens from above, and to the earth, that he may judge his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> Pſalm 50.
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>At whoſe Judgement the Powers of Heaven ſhall be ſhaken, and the firmament ſhall paſs away with fervent heat; Hell ſhall give up its dead, and every creature ſhall tremble,</hi> he it this day ſet at naught, and deſpiſed as the vileſt fellow in the world, and condemned to die. But wo and alas!</p>
               <p n="1">1. How were the hearts of his Diſciples, and the reſt of his friends overcharged with ſadneſs and grief, when all hope of life was taken away, and they heard that their faithfull Maſter, their Lord and Helper was condemned by a moſt unrighteous Judgement.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="314" facs="tcp:171778:196"/> 2. On the contrary, what a frantick fit of jollity and howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exultation were theſe mad dogs put into, when they had at laſt prevailed with the Judge by their importunate clamours to grant them their moſt abominable and horrid requeſt, which he had ſo often denyed them before, when the wicked Judge deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up Jeſus the Saviour to the curſed, and moſt cruel will of thoſe who thirſted ſo much after his blood?</p>
               <p n="3">3. How did the hopeleſs ſadneſs of his friends, and the furious mirth of his foes, torture and afflict this meekeſt Lamb now in the midſt of Wolves?</p>
               <p n="1">1. Here we ſee, Chriſtians, what we muſt have expected at Gods Judgement day, even the Sentence of Eternal Death, if Chriſt had not took pity on us, and taken it upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We ſee what little confidence we are to put in the World, when <hi>Pilate</hi> who had hitherto ſo often ſtood in defence of Chriſt, now to gratifie and pleaſe the <hi>Iews,</hi> doth crucifie him without any other cauſe in the world. So <hi>Herod</hi> heard <hi>Iohn</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, yet cut off his head at laſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 6. This unrighteous Sentence Chriſt took and accepted of, to free us from the moſt juſt Sentence of damnation; and to teach us not to fear the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous judgement of the World. Let us alwayes remember this Judgement, that we may with all our might and whole hearts give thanks to our Lord Chriſt, who would be condemned to death for us, and be delivered to the will of the wicked <hi>Iews;</hi> yea he delivered himſelf, that we might be able to ſtand before the Judgement of God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they took off the purple from him,
<note place="margin">Mar. 15.20.</note> and put his own cloaths on him, and led him out to crucifie him. And he bearing his croſs, went forth,</hi> John 19.17. <hi>And as they came out, they found a man of</hi> Cyrene, Simon <hi>by name,</hi> Mat. 27.32. <hi>who paſſed by, coming out of the Countrey, the father of</hi> Alexander <hi>and</hi> Rufus, <hi>Mark</hi>
15.21. <hi>and they laid hold upon him,</hi> Luke 23.26. <hi>him they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to bear his croſs,</hi> Mat. ibid. <hi>and they laid the croſs on him, that he might bear it after Ieſus. And there followed him a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of people, and of women, which alſo bewailed and lamented him. And Ieſus turning unto them, ſaid, Daughters of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>weep not for me, but weep for your ſelves, and for your children. For behold the dayes are coming, in the which they ſhall ſay, Bleſſed
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:171778:196"/> are the barren, and the Wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave ſuck. Then ſhall they begin to ſay to the Mountains, fall on us, and to the Hills, cover us. For if they do theſe things in a green Tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?</hi> Luke 23.27.</p>
               <p>Deareſt Brethren and friends of God, you who wait to hear the end of the ſaving crucifying of the bleſſed Lord and beloved Jeſus; the good God imprint in your hearts the memory of this great ſuffering, that thereby you may not only be more ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened in your Faith, but alſo animated and encouraged in pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to undergo the like, if need ſo require,
<hi>Amen.</hi> Invocate the Lords mercy, and with moſt fervent minds pray for all <hi>Iews, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans, Hereticks,</hi> ſinners and ſinnereſſes, that God the Father and Creator of all, would beſtow his Grace and Mercy upon all men, whereby they may be converted from unbelief to the Faith, and from a wicked life to godlineſs. O thou moſt high God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this ſo infinite Paſſion, and be not angry with us for ever. Theſe things I thought good to premiſe, to ſtir up your minds, and make ye more attentive to thoſe things which now follow.</p>
               <p>We have heard (firſt) what our Lord ſuffered before finall ſentence was paſt upon him. We have heard (ſecondly) what that ſentence was: to wit, that he ſhould be crucified. Now (thirdly) we ſhall hear next, how that ſentence was put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. Here then let us give all attention, not ſo much with the ears of our body, as of our mind. The next thing to be done, is to open the Veins of the Fountain of living Waters, that that precious balſam which pierceth and ſofteneth the hearts of all the godly may flow out.</p>
               <p>After that wicked ſentence was pronounced, thoſe truculent and bloody Wolves took that meekeſt Lamb Jeſus, to rend him in pieces and deſtroy him utterly, a thing which they had long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, and now at laſt had obtained. So that what Chriſt had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, was now fulfilled, to wit, that the world ſhould rejoice in his ſufferings, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15. Then is the world glad when it may do what it liſteth without controul, when there is none to reprove it, &amp; when it hath thoſe that rebuke it under its own power; they took Chriſt like a Lyon that is greedy of his prey,
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 17. Now the Lyon when he hath got his prey, he doth carry it away preſently, leſt
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:171778:197"/> it ſhould be taken from him. The Lyons whelps inſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour that part of the prey which their Sires bring to the Dens, leſt the other yong Lyons ſhould ſnatch it out oft heir paws. And thus they dealt with Chriſt. So do theſe wicked men ſeem to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, for this was their hour and power of darkneſs. Not that the wicked do truly and indeed prevail againſt Chriſt, but in that he emptied himſelf, and was made obedient even to the death of the Croſs. The Souldiers are here Emphatically expreſſed, for theſe alſo mocked Chriſt in
<hi>Pilates</hi> houſe, and now they take the place of hangmen, to lead away Chriſt and crucifie him; for this was not a meet work for the <hi>Iews.</hi> But for all that the chief Prieſts of the <hi>Iews</hi> ought more juſtly to be termed the crucifiers of Chriſt, inaſmuch as they firſt laid hands on him, and were the cauſe of his death. And indeed they were the true crucifiers of him. So that <hi>Peter</hi> tells them, <hi>Ye by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain,</hi> Acts 2. And a little after, <hi>Even Ieſus whom ye have crucified, hath God raiſed from the dead. Stephen</hi> tells them the ſame, calling them <hi>the betrayers and murtherers of Jeſus that juſt One,</hi> Acts 7. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith plainly that the <hi>Jews</hi> did <hi>crucifie the Lord of Glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. For what they did by other hands, is all one as if they had done it by their own.</p>
               <p>The Souldiers then took Jeſus, for he was now delivered into their power: and not only unto their power, but alſo to their moſt perverſe and wicked will. And becauſe they were in earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, they now pull off the jeſting garment, and put his own cloaths upon him again, to his greater confuſion, and to make the more ſport with him, that he might be the better known by his own cloaths, foraſmuch as he could hardly be known by his face, it was ſo ſpit on, buffeted, beaten and deformed. But the Crown they let alone upon his head: for they would not in the leaſt lighten or leſſen his pains, although this was done by Gods providence, to ſhew that Chriſt who was once crowned King, abideth a King for ever: nor can any take away his Kingdom, or pull his Crown off from him, his Royal Crown. Therefore it became him to clime the Croſs when he was crowned, that in that his Sacrifice, he might at once ſhew himſelf to be both King and Prieſt. So they led him away. Thus theſe wicked Husbandmen caſt the Son and Heir of the Father out of his Vineyard, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. Here comes in that Figure of the Goat, which was to be
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:171778:197"/> offered for ſin, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16. That was to be burnt without the Camp; but his blood was to be ſprinkled within the City in three places. The Tabernacle was to be ſprinkled with it in the inſide, and the Sanctuary and the Altar on the outſide. So the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus who was to waſh away the ſins of all men, ſprinkled his blood within the City in three places, in the houſe of <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<hi>Pilates</hi> Hall when he was tyed to the whipping poſt, and in the Judgement Hall when he was crowned with Thorns. Now being to be burnt, through his abundant love upon the Croſs, he is led without the City. And he is not brought forth as a Preacher of the Truth, but he is cryed out upon, mockt, derided, hiſſed at as a Prevaricator, as a Thief, as a Magician, as a Seducer, as a Blaſphemer. <hi>All they that ſee me,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>laugh me to ſcorn: they ſhoot out the lip, and ſhake the head,</hi> Pſalm 22. And again, <hi>They that ſit in the gate ſpeak againſt me, and I was the ſong of the drunkards,</hi> Pſalm 69. Thus he is led forth, he that leadeth his people out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> the City of the Devil, and the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of wicked men, into <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the holy Church. He that took his people out of Hell to be his Inheritance, is now caſt out of his own Heritage. <hi>He came unto his own, and his own received him not.</hi> He that delivered his people from the fellowſhip of Devils, is now led forth among Thieves and Rogues. He that leads his people to Triumph, is now led, or rather drag'd to death. Thus curſed <hi>Cain</hi> leads his innocent brother into the field to kill him, <hi>Gen</hi> 4. O how unlike was this out-leading of Chriſt unto that, when hereto fore heled their Fathers out of
<hi>Aegypt.</hi> There it is ſaid: <hi>He brought them forth with joy and gladneſs:</hi> but here he is led out with great anxiety and ſorrow,
<hi>They were brought forth with ſilver and gold,</hi> Pſalm 105.37,43. but he is led forth in greateſt miſery and want. O miſerable out-leading indeed! He was not ſo entertain'd in the City but ſix dayes ago: for then he was deſired as the Sacrificial Lamb, now he is ſlain: then they bore up his Aſs; now his knees falter under the burdenſom Croſs: then he was accompanied with his Diſciples, now he is made a companion for Thieves and Robbers: then they ſtrawed the croſs-wayes with Flowers, Palm branches, and garments; now they force him to run through mire and dirt, to go through thick and thin, they drive him along rough and ſtony-places: then the very boyes did even melt their mouths into praiſes, ſaving,
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:171778:198"/> 
                  <hi>Glory, honour and praiſe be unto thee, O Chriſt our King and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, Bleſſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord, Hoſanna in the Higheſt;</hi> but now all is full of nothing but wrong, reproach, deriſion and curſing. O how unlike each other are theſe, <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>Away with him, away with him, crucifie him?</hi> How unlike are theſe, <hi>King of</hi> Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and <hi>We have no King but</hi> Caeſar? How unlike are green Branches and the Croſs, Flowers and Thorns? And that this Eduction may be made more penal to him, they make him carry his own croſs, a thing never ſeen or heard of before; this they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell him to carry from <hi>Pilates</hi> houſe out of the City, whereby they might make his ſin greater then the ſin of thoſe Thieves, and that the ſufferings of Chriſt might more perfectly ſatisfie for our ſins. <hi>And he went forth,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>bearing his Croſs.</hi> A grand Spectacle, a great gazing-ſtock indeed: but to a godly man this is a great Myſterie; for here that of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was fulfilled: <hi>The Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhall be upon his ſhoulders,</hi> Iſa. 9. The Government of Chriſt is his Croſs, for ſubmitting whereunto he was <hi>exalted of the Father,</hi> Phil. 2. Here thoſe Figures were fulfilled: for here is <hi>Abel</hi> led forth by his brother to be kill'd: Here is <hi>Iſaac</hi> with the wood, and
<hi>Abraham</hi> with the Ram caught in the thicket, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. Here is
<hi>Joſeph</hi> with his party-coloured coat beſmeared with blood,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 37. Here is <hi>Moſes</hi> with his Serpent put upon the Pole,
<hi>Numb.</hi> 21. Here is the Bunch of Grapes upon the Staff, <hi>Numb.</hi>
13. O how bitter and irkſome was it to Chriſt to depart out of that City which he ſo highly eſteeme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, as to make it as it were equal to Heaven in Wealth, Power, Dominion, Religion, but would neither now nor henceforth afford it either his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence or aſſiſtance, becauſe of the iniquity thereof, and would leave the Vine which his right hand had planted, to be devoured by the Bore and every wild beaſt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 80. This was Chriſts laſt farewell to the
<hi>Jews;</hi> nor hath he ever ſince unto this very day returned again to them. Never man went ſo willingly to ſerve God, as he haſted to
<hi>Calvery</hi> to be crucified. Let us go forth with him, at leaſt thinking upon his reproach, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. Moſt truly is it ſaid of him, <hi>that he did bear his croſs:</hi> for he did not bear it outwardly only, but inwardly too. Nor was there ever man carried ſuch a heavy croſs as Chriſt did. For,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>Firſt he carried an outward croſs, which being made infamous
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:171778:198"/> by the curſe, and burdenſome by the weight of it, did grievouſly preſs and gawl his raw and wounded ſhoulders. It may well be thought, that by this carrying of the croſs, all the skin of his ſhoulders to the very raw fleſh, was ſo fret, and feak'd, and rub'd, that either all his ſores were renewed afreſh, or were ſo extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torn, that they were made all but one wound. For the croſs being long and heavy, and Jeſus quite tyred out, he could not carry it but one end on his ſhoulders, and the other dragging on the ground: ſo that the continual jogging and jolting of it, as he haled along over ſtones and rugged ground, muſt needs wound the wounded ſhoulders of the Lord more deeply: and ſometimes hitting againſt his head put him to freſh pain, by beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prickles of the Thorny crown into his head. Indeed no Tongue can tell, nor is any man able to expreſs what pain and torment Chriſt endured under this Croſs: and no doubt but that he was ſo weary and weakened, that many times he fell down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the load and weight of the Croſs. All theſe things were thus done and written, to ſhew us that they uſed Chriſt moſt unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully. And thus ſhould we have been tortured eternally with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any hope of pity, if Chriſt had not taken all upon himſelf in our ſtead. Now they lay this Croſs upon him,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To put him to the greater pain and ſhame. For they were ſo impatent, that they could not ſtay till they came to the place of Execution.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They lay the croſs on him, becauſe no body elſe would ſo much as touch that wood, it was ſo odious by reaſon of the curſe. Thus all of us do ſtill abominate, loth and fly the Croſs of Chriſt which we ſhould bear for Chriſt, whereas for the moſt part we are forced to endure greater things in and from the world. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, It was not this outward croſs only that oppreſſed Chriſt. There was another ſpiritual Croſs which did cruciate and lye heavy upon the mind of holy Jeſus with no leſs bitterneſs, from the minute he was born, to the very hour of his death, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any refreſhment of joy. This croſs was our ſins. For the ſins of all men were laid upon the croſs of Chriſt. It was he that bear our ſins, in his own body on the Tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and upon him the Lord laid the iniquity of us all, <hi>Iſa</hi> 53. This Talent of Lead, theſe cords of impiety, theſe faggots of Thorns, which
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:171778:199"/> were heavier then any Mountain, did grievouſly ſurcharge Chriſt. This huge load that would have broken the ſtrength of Heaven, bowed all the Spheres, Orbs, and Regions of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, mouldred the foundation of the earth, and cruſht in pieces all things here below, this heavy and intolerable burden was bound to the back of holy Jeſus. Where by the way we may take notice of our ingratitude: We ſin, but avoid the croſs, and ſuffer it to lye on innocent Chriſt, and never ſo much as give him thanks for all his pains. How great therefore muſt our condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation be? Although Chriſt alone felt the load and weight of the croſs, yet he did not bear it for himſelf, who had no ſin, but he bare it to us, and for us, and that two wayes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. He carried the croſs before us Miniſterially, ſerving and miniſtring to us thereby. For his croſs is our croſs: which he took from our ſhoulders, and laid upon his own. Now the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purtenance of the croſs, is the curſe: <hi>Curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree,</hi> Deut. 21. And this is that which is moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable in the croſs. For happily the croſs might have been endured in reſpect of the pain: but when the curſe was added, that made it become moſt extreamly miſerable. Wherefore when Chriſt took our croſs upon him, he undertook the curſe alſo of the croſs. For he was made an execration &amp; a curſe for us, that we might be delivered from the curſe of the Law. The croſs and curſe both were ours: but Chriſt bare them both Miniſterially before us. When thy ſins affright thee, thy conſcience tormenteth thee, and the curſe oppreſſeth thee, do but conſider and think upon this, and thou ſhalt never deſpair.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt bare the croſs before us for our Example, that we ſhould follow his ſteps, <hi>Chriſt hath ſuffered for us, leaving us an example,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. And Chriſt himſelf ſaith, <hi>He that will come after me, let him deny himſelf and take up his croſs,</hi> Matth. 16. Again, <hi>He that taketh not up his croſs, and cometh after me, he is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 10. The croſs muſt be born what ever come on't. For the Word is ſtedfaſt: <hi>In the world ye ſhall have tribulation,</hi> John 16. And through many tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>But the croſs is too heavy for us, and more then we are able to bear: we are too weak and cannot carry it in our own ſtrength?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:171778:199"/> 
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> What muſt we do then? Throw away the croſs, or ſhun it? In no wiſe: but rather look upon and behold the croſs of Chriſt. But thou askeſt how is that, how muſt that be done? Lo Chriſt who was the only begotten Son of God, and bleſſed over all, it could not be, but that he did bleſs and ſanctifie all things whatſoever he did but touch. For as filthy, curſed, ſinfull fleſh, whatſoever, as it did touch it, ſo it did torture it: (for to the impure all things are unclean: whence all things are curſed to the firſt man after he ſinned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 5. ſo that God himſelf doth ſhew himſelf froward with the froward, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 18. Hence the ſinner under the Law is loaden with many curſes: <hi>Curſed ſhalt thou be in the City, and in the field,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.) So on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; by the touch of the ever and above bleſſed Son of God are all things bleſt and ſanctified, even thoſe things which in themſelves were curſed before. Now Chriſt touched hunger, cold, perſecution, reproaches, ſweat of blood, the croſs, death, hell: And he ſo bleſſed all theſe things by his touching them, and ſo ſanctified them, that they ſhall never more burt, but help, never more be for evil, but for good to them that believe. And therefore whenſoever any of theſe afflict thee, ſee that above all things thou look to Chriſt in thy croſs and tribulation, which if thou doeſt, thou ſhalt not only bear up in thy affliction, or againſt the cruel rage of perſecutors, but ſhalt withall glory and triumph in thy adverſity and affliction, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. A figure here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was in the Waters of
<hi>Marah:</hi> which were ſo bitter that none could drink of them: but when
<hi>Moſes</hi> had caſt the wood which God ſhewed him into them, they became ſweet and pleaſant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 15.25. This is that Tree of Chriſts croſs which ſweetens all bitter things to us. So the poverty of Chriſt makes our pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty comfortable; his death makes ours joyfull,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Learn hence patiently to endure thy travell in the way to Heaven; And cheer up thy ſelf from this, that thou maiſt be able to bear thy croſs. Come hither, I ſay, whoſoever thou art that art hunted and hurryed to death, either for Righteouſneſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake or Innocency. For in this leading of Chriſt away to the croſs, yea even at the croſs, thou ſhalt there by faith find thy ſelf, that even as Chriſt ſeemed to the world to be led to a moſt filthy and ſhamefull death, and yet indeed was guided to a glory far more glorious then all glory; ſo if thou art a member of

                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:171778:201"/> Chriſt by Faith, thou wilt ſeem to be carried away into extream miſery, but yet thou ſhalt be convoyed unto eternal Joy. For to this end Chriſt came unto this hour, that he might lead thee along with himſelf thorow death unto life. This is our comfort, that Chriſt bare his croſs. Let none therefore deſpair under his ſins, or faint under his outward ſufferings, but in both conditions let him look up unto Chriſt: it will lighten his burden, and he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſtrong conſolation.</p>
               <p>But obſerve this, that it is not enough to bear a croſs. For every croſs doth not lead to life, but only the croſs of Chriſt. There are four ſorts of men that carry the croſs. Firſt, Some bear it willingly, as godly men do. Some unwillingly, as wicked and worldly men, for they alſo are not without their croſs, but they carry it very unwillingly, like <hi>Simon.</hi> Others bear the croſs, but tis other mens, not their own, this they utterly refuſe and reject, as the Hypocrites do. There are others who bear the croſs indeed, yet they follow not Chriſt, but the Devil rather, as all ungodly men do. Look thou therefore to it, that thou bear thine own croſs, and follow Chriſt alſo. But hear what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: <hi>And as they came out, they found a certain man paſſing by,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here we ſee that verified which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>God is faithfull, who will not ſuffer you to be tempted above what ye are able, but will with the temptation make a way of eſcape, that ye may be able to bear it.</hi> In this reſpect that <hi>Simon</hi> here named was ſent to meet Chriſt. Nor ſhalt thou want ſome <hi>Simon</hi> or other to eaſe and comfort thee, if thou conſtantly hold out in perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and temptation. Therefore do the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſo punctual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcribe this man by his name, his countrey, and his condition, for the greater confirmation of our Faith: and that we may not doubt, but that we ſhall find ſome to ſuccour us in our diſtreſs. His name was
<hi>Simon,</hi> which ſignifieth attentive, or obedient. None but the attentive and obedient do bear the croſs profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. By countrey he was a
<hi>Cyrenaean,</hi> from <hi>Cyrene,</hi> which was a <hi>Pentapolis,</hi> or one of the five Cities. This <hi>Simon</hi> happily might be a
<hi>Proſelite,</hi> or perhaps ſome <hi>Jews</hi> might then dwell there. Moreover his children are here named, that none may doubt of what was done. The Souldiers laid hold on him, and compell him to bear the croſs, which no man elſe would ſo much as touch,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:171778:201"/> they were all ſo affrighted with that word of Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the curſe of the Tree. Therefore they compell this <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to bear the croſs, not out of any good will to lighten or eaſe Chriſt in the leaſt of his heavy burden: but either becauſe Chriſt went ſo falteringly and feebly, they had not patience to go ſo ſlowly, all delay was tedious, and they thought long before they came to the place: or elſe becauſe they would reſerve him for greater tortures. Thus whom the world doth cheer up &amp; make merry for a time, thoſe it doth torment afterward with its cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer uſage. So the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> at firſt entertained the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> with greateſt reſpect and honour; but into what ſtreights and troubles did they force them afterward? Read <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. &amp; 2. And <hi>David</hi> was firſt ſent for from the ſheep-fold to the Kings Court: but afterwards was forced to flye for ſafety of his life. The friendſhip and good will of this world doth end in enmity and hatred.</p>
               <p n="1">1. But that which is here reported of <hi>Simon,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> did not fall out without a Myſterie. For firſt, this <hi>Simon</hi> may be a Type of all obedient Chriſtians, who with Chriſt do carry their croſs, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though their fleſh ſtand in ſuch reluctancy that it muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to that which is for its welfare. And therefore <hi>Origen</hi> calls this a wholſome compulſion. For our fleſh will not bear the croſs except it be forced and mortified by the Spirit of God, which compulſion is yet very profitable for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas <hi>Simon</hi> did indeed bear the croſs, but did not dye upon it, he is a figure of thoſe, who for a time do carry the croſs with Chriſt, but do not perſevere and hold out to the end.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor doth it want a Myſterie, that Chriſt did firſt carry the croſs; and afterward <hi>Simon.</hi> For none of us had been able to bear the croſs, if Chriſt had not born it firſt. But what more did yet happen in this progreſs? <hi>And a great multitude,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>followed Jeſus.</hi> It behooved and twas fit that all the people ſhould be preſent when the High Prieſt did offer and compleat his Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. But they did not all follow him with the ſame mind and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. The High Prieſts who had ſo earneſtly importuned his death, did follow him, being glad to ſee him dye. The women followed him as they that loved him when he lived, and deſired that he might yet live longer; but when he was going to dye,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:171778:202"/> when he was dying, and when he was dead, they greatly lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his loſs. But it did not cauſe the women only to bewail him ſo, as if they alone and not very many men too were moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull for his ſuffering: but becauſe the female ſex, which is leaſt taken notice of in ſuch caſes, might be more bold to expreſs their grief when the Rulers were preſent. The women then did religiouſly lament him, but they bewailed only his humanity. And indeed what Unbeliever, what Infidel (ſo he be but a man) would not be troubled to behold this miſerable condition of Chriſt, whereas godly men can hardly hold from weeping when they ſee deſerved puniſhment inflicted upon others? But Jeſus takes no notice of the raging multitude, but (knowing who are his) he turneth himſelf to the women who did both love and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him, and forbids them to weep: Not that it was evil to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo great ſuffering, and ſuch wrong that was done to Jeſus, but becauſe it was not comely to bewail and weep for him, as they uſe to do for others that are juſtly puniſhed. <hi>Daughters of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, faith he, ye need not weep for me, who am now finiſhing this my ſad progreſs. For I do not ſuffer theſe things for my own faults; yea this my going away (though you know it not) ſhall bring joy and great good to all the world. Mourning doth not ſait with Triumph, nor doth ſorrow become Victory. But if ye are reſolved to lament, do it for your ſelves and for your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, although ye go not, or be not with me in this progreſs. For I would have ye know, that in this very place I foretell you of ſuch ſad, diſmall, and dangerous times which are coming, that all, as well men as women, as well yong men as old, both rich and poor, ſhall come into ſuch great ſtreights, that they ſhall wiſh they had never been born. Happy (ſaith he) ſhall that woman be, who hath neither ſons nor daughters, for whom ſhe muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer ſo great ſorrow. Yea ſo great ſhall be the perplexity and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, that you will wiſh your ſelves under ground, and to be hid in the cloſe caverns of the Mountains and clefts of the Rocks, where none might ſee or find you out. For whatſoever ſhall be ſeen or found, ſhall not eſcape death, no though it had a thouſand heads. O therefore ye Citizens of this bloody City, conſider of what I ſay, and weep and wail for thoſe things that ſhall come upon you. <hi>For if they do theſe things in the green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry tree?</hi> He calleth himſelf &amp; his Elect the
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:171778:202"/> green Tree: but the dry Tree ſignifieth ſinners and wicked. <hi>If I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who have committed no ſin, who am juſtly called the Tree of life, becauſe I bring forth the fruits of Grace all the twelve moneths,</hi> Rev. 22. If I leave not the world without paſſing thorow the fire of my Paſſion; what torment do you think they ſhall have who are not only barren themſelves, but are ſo bold, and ſo bad, as to ſet on fire, and burn down the very Tree of life it ſelf? <hi>If this be the time that Judgement begin at the houſe of God, and all they that live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2 Tim. 3. <hi>What ſhall be the end of thoſe that obey not the Gospel of God?</hi> 1 Pet. 4. But you will ask, <hi>Whereto tendeth that terrible Propheſie of Chriſt?</hi> Mat. 24. I anſwer, It hath reſpect to the war of the Jews, that is, unto the great miſery and deſolation, the like whereof was never read of or ſeen before, which after fourty years did totally ruine the Jews, even that notable and deſtructive war of the <hi>Romans</hi> againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Emperors
<hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> which War nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Joſephus,</hi> nor <hi>Egeſippus</hi> were able fully to deſcribe. This diſtreſs and utter ruine of the Jews Chriſt foretold, not only here, but elſewhere, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 21. And if <hi>Titus</hi> in his rage ſmote the Jews with ſuch fear and lamentation, with what terrour ſhall Chriſt, who is the Judge of the quick, and of the dead, ſmite all Nations when he is angry, who ſhall judge righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, as he was unrighteouſly judged?</p>
               <p>Chriſt then is that green and fruitfull Tree ſpoken of,
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 1. &amp; 52. For what was better and more fruitfull then he?
<hi>The Jews</hi> on the contrary <hi>were the dry and barren Tree,</hi> Mat.
3. Luke 13. Men will not ſuddenly out down young and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing Trees, eſpecially if they be fruitfull: but if ſuch be hewen down, wo to the barren, fruitleſs, old, dry Trees: And if the <hi>Roman</hi> ſouldiers dealt ſo cruelly with innocent Chriſt, it may eaſily be concluded how miſerably the wicked and ſinfull Jews were to be deſtroyed. Thus the Word of Chriſt is made good and effectually fulfilled. Whence we learn,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To lament and bewail our ſelves in and over Chriſt. We ſhould not weep for Chriſt, but for our own ſins, which were ſo great, that they cauſed Chriſt, who was, and is the Son of God, to be put to death. And if the Son of God was ſo cruelly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for other mens ſins, what ſhould we have endured for
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:171778:203"/> our own ſins? The days will come indeed, when ſinners ſhall wiſh that they had never been born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let us therefore la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment us of our ſins here. The Paſſion of Chriſt doth certainly denounce this miſery againſt us before hand, except we convert and turn to him, and ſo eſcape, and be delivered by vertue of his ſufferings.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We are here taught, that the preſent evils of this life, which are but for a moment, ought not to be any cauſe of our mourning or heavineſs, but that we ſhould rather weep in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of future and eternal miſery. Theſe are they that ſhould be feared and bewailed. Chriſt did deplore the miſery of others upon the Croſs, and put them in mind of the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come, who did not only refuſe, but perſecute the Grace of God which was then offered them, that thereby they might be terrified from ſin. It follows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And there were alſo two other Malefactors led with him to be put to death.
<note place="margin">Luke 23.32.</note> And they bring him unto the place which in</hi> Hebrew <hi>is called</hi> Golgatha, <hi>that is, being interpreted,</hi> the place of a Skull, Mar. 15.22. John 19.17. <hi>And they gave him Vineger to drink, mingled with gall,</hi> Mat. 27.34. <hi>They gave him Wine mingled with Myrrh,</hi> Mar. 15.23. <hi>And when he had taſted thereof, he would not drink,</hi> Mat. ibid. <hi>And they crucified him, and with him two theeves, one on the right hand, and another on the left, and Jeſus in the midſt,</hi> Mat. 27.38. John 19.18. And the Scripture was fulfilled, which ſaith, <hi>And he was numbred with the tranſgreſſors,</hi> Mar. 15.28.</p>
               <p>Deareſt Brethren, we are almoſt now come with our Lord Chriſt unto the very place where he was willing to die a moſt bitter death for all ſinners, and have followed hard after him, treading in every ſtep that he trode, yet have we not gone without grief for our ſins, which were the cauſe of all this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to Chriſt, inaſmuch as it was not he, but we that deſerved the death.</p>
               <p>The place where Chriſt ſuffered is exactly deſcribed by the Evangeliſts, that all men might not doubt, but give the more credit to the truth of the Hiſtory. Now that place in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> was called
<hi>Gulgoleth,</hi> or in the <hi>Chaldee, Golgoltha,</hi> which ſignifieth ſomething that is round, as is the head of a man, or the Skull, Brain-pan, or Shell of the head. And that place was ſo name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:171778:203"/> becauſe there lay the heads of ſlain men. Nor did the Evangeliſts bluſh, nor are we aſhamed to confeſs, that Chriſt was crucified in that place, where Malefactors were wont to be executed, yea, we count it our glory. For Chriſt did exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly honour this ſhamefull place with his holy death, ſo that 'tis no longer a place of condemned perſons, but a true Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary for us; inaſmuch as there he ſhed his moſt holy blood for us. To this place do they lead Chriſt, accompanied with two theeves, that the Banner of Martyrdom might be diſplay'd where the Gallows uſe to ſtand. As there is no place more filthy than that of Calvary, ſo Chriſt being brought thither, did deſcend into extream filthineſs, to purge and cleanſe it away. And by this his Deſcenſion whereby he threw himſelf into the utmoſt abominations, he aſcended unto the higheſt Glory. Chriſt hath another ladder than what the world hath, by which he climbeth up on high, even into the heights of Heaven. The world by climbing on high, reacheth after high things; but the higher it climbeth, the lower it falleth, and tumbleth head long into the bottomleſs Gulf. But Chriſt preſſeth into the heights above, by deſcending into the depths beneath; and the lower he ſinks down, the higher he riſeth up. For that ſaying ſtands firm, <hi>Every one that exalteth himſelf ſhall be abaſed, and he that humbleth himſelf, ſhall be exalted,</hi> Luke
18.14.</p>
               <p>When they had brought Chriſt to the place of his ſuffering, before they would crucifie him, they gave him drink, but it was a moſt bitter potion, mingled with Gall and Vineger, or Wine mixt with Myrrh; for they had nothing worſe, and more bitter to offer him. O cruel impiety, which tendreth nothing at all of pitty and comfort to the afflicted in his diſtreſs. The Lord was toyl'd and wearied out all the night before, and had no reſpit to refreſh his ſpirit, becauſe of the loathſome and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſpittle, and furious buffettings all that while. And now when he was quite ſpent, and had waſted all his ſtrength, when he was parcht and drie, when he was come to the place where he was willing to die, that Wine which the faithfull and the godly were wont to give to them that are ſad and heavy heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 31. even to them that were going to execution, that Wine thoſe notorious knaves had drunk up, and inſtead of it, they offered Chriſt this moſt bitter potion, to fulfill that of the
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:171778:204"/> 
                  <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69. <hi>They gave me gall for my meat, and in my thirſt they gave me Vineger to drink.</hi> Well might Chriſt take up that of <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. <hi>My choice and noble Vineyard, how art thou turned into bitterneſs unto me?</hi> Now Chriſt did taſt indeed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, but he would not drink it, and taſte it he did, to perſwade us that death is not hurtfull but wholeſom. For as a Phyſitian doth firſt taſte the potion, to perſwade his Patient to take it: ſo Chriſt did firſt taſte of death, (a bitter cup indeed) that we might the more cheerfully pledge him. Thus <hi>Paul, We ſee Jeſus,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>crowned with Glory and Honour, that he by the Grace of God ſhould taſt death for every man,</hi> Heb. 2.9. Here comes in that of the Prophet, <hi>O death, I will be thy death,</hi> Hoſ. 13. Again, <hi>Death is ſwallowed up in victory,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.</p>
               <p>Here now beginneth the very crucifying it ſelf, when the moſt holy, tender and pure body of Chriſt was ſtript ſtark naked, ſtretched out, racked and faſtned to the bare hard tree, to the extream torture of the Lord Jeſus. We muſt not paſs this over lightly, but inſiſt a little upon it; for now we are come to the very ſum and upſhot of the Paſſion. The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts do very briefly, even in one word expreſs this matter, <hi>viz. And they crucified him.</hi> They ſay but little, yet leave us much to meditate upon. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They ſpoil and plunder him again, before they crucifie him. They ſtrip him of his cloaths, who cloatheth the Heaven with ſtars, and the earth with flowers; and as the firſt man <hi>lived</hi> in Paradiſe, ſo the ſecond <hi>Adam entred</hi> into Paradiſe: He ſuffered himſelf to be ſpoiled, that he might recover the Robe of innocency for us again. He did not refuſe to be ſtript naked before men, that we might not be found naked before God. He indured Confuſion, that he might hide the guilt of our conſcience. <hi>Bleſſed is he whoſe ſins are covered,</hi> Pſalm 32.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Here we ſee in him the deepeſt poverty that ever was; for although (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.) <hi>He was rich, yet for our ſakes he became poor;</hi> he deſcended and left the unutterable riches of Heaven, he came down into the world, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing all thoſe riches in the world whatſoever, yet he did not diſdain to be nurſed up by his mother, the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the ſervice &amp; attendance of others. For he had his food and rayment from them; and although the ſon of man had not then

But now this day he lies under the greateſt poverty and want that ever man did; his mother is not permitted to do any thing for him, no not ſo much as to come near him: when he was thirſty he had nothing but Gall and Myrrh allowed him for his meat and drink: All ſhelter and ſuccour is taken from him, he hath not where to put his head: He is caſt out of every Hovel, Houſe, and City: He is crucified under the open Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

                  <hi>Croſs of Jeſus.</hi> Never do we read of the like poverty any where, no not in
<hi>Lazarus</hi> himſelf when he was moſt ſcabby, fore though no man bound up his wounds, and there was none to waſh or anoint him, yet the Dogs licked his ſoars, and did more for him than any man would do, <hi>Luke</hi>
16. Although no man would give him any cloaths, yet his own poor rags were not taken from him. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="1">1. What great miſery Chriſt did indure when his cloaths were pul'd off him, no tongue can expreſs. For when they did vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently and haſtily rap and rend his cloaths off him which were next to his moſt holy fleſh, being all gore, weltring and ſticking faſt to thoſe wounds which the whips had made, as being impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to delay the Lords death any longer, they could not but renew the wounds afreſh: They tore off his cloaths ſo furiouſly, that the <hi>Sanies</hi> or putrid matter guſh'd out with the blood with much cruelty, and greater pain than it was cauſed by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer whipping. So that if Chriſt had ſuffered nothing before, this only miſuſage of him had been ſufficient to redeem the world. For we ſee by experience, that if a little woollen cloath be clapt on a green wound, it will make it feſter, and if it be ſuddenly ſnatcht off, it puts the party to far greater pain and torment, and is intolerable in compariſon of the pain when it was firſt inflicted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was no ſmall aggravation of the pain, that his moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p n="3">3. To ſay nothing of that confuſion, which doubtleſs was moſt exceeding great, thus to be ſtript bare and naked before all his friends and foes too. Moſt truly therefore may he ſay to every one of us,
<hi>For thy ſake have I ſuffered reproach, ſhame hath covered my face,</hi> Pſalm 69. See here, O man, what thou haſt ſtood thy God in, and what it coſt him to ſave thee! But hearken, and I will tell thee more yet; liſten, and thou ſhalt hear greater things.</p>
               <p>When they had thus ſtript the Lord naked, they make ready the Croſs before his face, to increaſe his ſorrow; and the floor or place is prepared and fitted where the true Lamb is to be offered for the whole world. The wicked Officers then bore holes in the Croſs. And then preſently in a mad rage they ſling up Chriſt to the top of the Croſs, naked, and nothing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but the crown of thorns. O Heaven, O Earth, O Sea, never did ye ſee a more ſad ſpectacle before. Firſt, They catch his left hand, and with an Hammer and ſharp nail of an inch thick they faſten it to the Croſs, ſo that the nail carried with it the very palm and fleſh of his hand into the hole, that one would think, it rather ſoldered with the Iron than nayled. With like cruelty, but more cruel torture, they ſerve his right hand. The holes were made too far aſunder, ſo that his hands could not reach to them when his arms were ſtretched forth. Beſides, The ſinews (as is uſual) did ſo contract and ſhrink up to aſſiſt each other, that when his right hand was to be put againſt the hole in the croſs, it could not come to it by much. Therefore they uſe other Inſtruments of cruelty, and with cords faſtened thereto, they extend and rack out his arms. Some bind his left hand again, and hold it with all diligence, that it may not ſlip: Others ſtretch out his right hand till it come to the place where the nail was to be put in, and then peirce and faſten it. Then they torture and rack his feet with the ſame cruelty, drive in the nail, extend, rack, ſtretch him, till all his joynts and Ham-ſtrings break: ſo that one might tell all his Nerves, Veins, Fibers, Strings and Bones, and there was not a wrinkle to be ſeen in all his body. Thus <hi>Davids</hi> Prophetical
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:171778:206"/> Harp is ſcrued up and tuned, and that fulfilled here which he propheſied, <hi>They peirced my hands and my feet; I may tell all my bones,</hi> Pſalm 22. This immaculate Lamb did not in the leaſt bleat or open his mouth when he was led to the ſlaughter to be offered upon the Altar of the Croſs faſt bound and faſtened thereunto,
<hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. Liſten then, O Chriſtian, and obſerve with all diligence. Chriſt hitherto ſuffered many things, but it was only in the fleſh: Now we come to the very extremity, to the marrow and in moſt pain, and grief of Chriſt. Now his Nerves and Bones are tortured, which is a moſt vehement pain in the hands and feet, where the ſinews and bones are ſo near together, that they cannot be disjoyned without extream torture. But this way muſt Chriſt cure our ſins, becauſe there was no ſoundneſs in man from the crown of the head to the ſole of the foot, neither outwardly, nor inwardly, therefore muſt Chriſt be expoſed to ſuffer in all parts of his body. He ſpread forth his arms, to ſhew that he did voluntarily, and out of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt love indure all theſe things. He let his feet be pierced and faſtened, to ſhew that he would never ſtand ſtill or give over till he had made full ſatisfaction for us. He offered up his whole body for a burnt Offering, to reconcile the Father unto us, and to teach us to give up every Member unto the obedience of Chriſt. How well then might Chriſt here ſpeak and complain againſt the Jewiſh people, O my people, What have I done unto thee, or wherein have I wearied thee? I ſmote <hi>Aegppt</hi> with its firſt born for thy ſake, and thou in Requital, haſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me to be ſcourged. I fed thee with Manna in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and thou haſt beaten me with Cuffs and Scourges. I gave thee water of life to drink out of the Rock, and thou haſt given me Vineger &amp; Call to drink. I ſmote the Kings of the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> for thee, and thou haſt ſmitten my head with a Reed. I gave thee a royal Scepter, and thou haſt ſet a Crown of thorns upon my head. I exaited and lifted thee up in great ſtrength, and thou haſt hanged me on the Gibbet of the Croſs. What ſhould I have done more, that I have not done for thee? I plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thee indeed my nobleſt and choiceſt Vineyard, and thou art turned into the greateſt bitterneſs againſt me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But let us leave the Jews, and come to do our own buſineſs. Conſider therefore, O man, this holy ſpectacle. Thoſe hands
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:171778:207"/> which in Wiſdom founded the Heavens, which were wont to looſe the Priſoners, to raiſe up the fallen, and to cure all men wich their touch, are now ſtretched out upon the Croſs. His feet with which he walked upon the ſea, whoſe very foot-ſtool is to be reverenced, thoſe feet I ſay, which never ſtood in the way of ſinners, but ever walked in the Law of the Lord, are now peirced with picked nails. His pureſt body, in which the hid treaſures of all Grace are laid up and kept, is ſtript quite naked, and bare, and faſtened to the Tree. His face that is fairer than the ſons of men, which did comfort all afflicted and ſorrowfull Ones, that face which the Angels deſire to behold, is now turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the paleneſs of a frightfull death. Sweeteſt Babe, what was thy offence, that thou ſhouldeſt be thus judged, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifully dealt with? What was thy hainous fact? What was thy Crime? What was the cauſe of thy ſorrow?
'Tis I, I am the cauſe of all thy pain and grief. I did eat the ſower grape, and thy teeth were ſet on edge. I wretched Creature, wretch that I am, do now laugh, prate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whilſt thou doſt lament, ſuffer, thirſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for me. I run after merry meetings, and love jovial Paſtimes, when thou doſt hang faſt upon the Croſs for me. I anoint, powder, and perfume my head, I paint my face, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate my skin, when thou doſt hang like a Leper, all to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with filthy ſpittle, gore blood, and rankled wounds. My hands ſtill work wickedneſs, as if I could never ſin enough, whilſt thy moſt harmleſs hands are faſtened to the Croſs for me. O ingratitude, worthy of all manner of puniſhment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted! Do we return thanks after this faſhion? How ought this crucifying of Chriſt to terrifie us from ſin? For what hope can we have of pardon, if we be not only unthankfull here, but do moreover crucifie Chriſt again with our ſins? Now there may be many reaſons given why Chriſt would be crucified. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Being thus ſet between Heaven and Earth, he might ſhew that he was the true Mediator of God and Man.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Becauſe ſin was firſt committed by eating of the fruit of the Tree, therefore would he expiate ſin upon the Tree.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Becauſe the Devil overcame man by the Tree, therefore would Chriſt conquer him upon the Tree.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt would be crucified after this manner, that by the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:171778:207"/> very poſture and form of his crucified body, we might learn what we are to expect from him. He ſtretched out his hands, to ſhew that the way to his Heart and tender Love was open to us. He let his feet be faſtened, to ſhew that he would not go back till we were fully Redeemed. He ſtretched out his right hand, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he came to beſtow good things upon us: and his left hand, that he might take away all evil from us. He let his right foot be nailed, becauſe he came to confirm and eſtabliſh the good: and his left, becauſe he would ſuppreſs all evil thoughts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He would be crucified, to ſhew the fruit of his ſufferings by the very faſhion of the croſs. For as the croſs hath four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſo there are four principal effects and fruits of the Lords Paſſion. The upper end which points towards Heaven, ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the Angelical Ruin was repaired by the Paſſion of Chriſt, and that Heaven was open for us. The lower end ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that thereby the Fathers were redeemed out of <hi>Limbo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Let not this expreſſion offend thee: but attend the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier things.</note> or from the borders of hell. The right corner ſheweth, that the diſperſed children of God were by it gathered together in the world. The left horn ſhews that by the croſs even his enemies were reconciled.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Chriſt would be crucified, thereby to ſhew of what faſhion the Chriſtian life is to be. For as the croſs hath thoſe four Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions: to wit, Length, Breadth, Height and Depth; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by are ſignified the four principal Virtues, in which the Life of Chriſtianity doth conſiſt. By the Depth is ſignified Faith, which is laid firſt in the bottom of the heart as a Foundation in Gods building by the ſecret and hidden Call of the Divine Will. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance is intimated by the Length: by the Height is Hope ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, and by the Breadth, Charity. For of theſe may that of the Apoſtle be underſtood, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. <hi>That ye may be able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend what is the length, breadth, height and depth,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="7">7. He would be crucified, to teach us that our whole body ſhould be put forth to the utmoſt in the ſervice of God, and that we ſhould crucifie the fleſh, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 2. Again, <hi>I bear in my body, the marks of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> Gal. 6. To offer up a mans ſelf is the moſt acceptable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice unto God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the faſtening of Chriſt to the croſs, which when they had ſo done, they rear up the croſs with great ſhoutings, with moſt bitter railings and revilings. There was a hole cut out
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:171778:208"/> of the Rock to faſten the foot of the croſs in. Into which place they do not let the croſs ſlide gently in, but they jolt it in with great violence on a ſudden, that they might add one more, and that the greateſt torture too to all his other ſufferings, to ſhake his very entrails, and to widen the wounds of his hands and feet again with ſo great and ſudden a jogg, which were filled before with the bluntneſs of the Nails, cauſing thoſe full and fertile Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volets of his blood to guſh out and overflow again. Thus that Spring of Paradiſe, the Fountain of Chriſts blood brake out from that pleaſant Garden, the place of pleaſure, even the body of the Lord, dividing it ſelf into four parts: to wit, into the clefts and holes of his hands and feet, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. By its plentifull and moſt abundant flowing, it watered the whole earth, waſhing away the ſins of all Believers. Here then was fulfilled that of Chriſt:
<hi>And I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>when I am lifted from the earth, will draw all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me,</hi> John 12. Again, <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted the Serpent in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, ſo muſt the ſon of Man be lifted up,</hi> John 3.
<hi>that whoſoever believed in him might not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> Here that figure of the Brazen Serpent was fulfilled, <hi>Numb.</hi>
21. Here was Chriſt ſtanding before God as the true Mediator between God and man; as the High Prieſt offering himſelf for us, and taking up that ſaying in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 40. <hi>Sacrifice and offering for ſin thou wouldeſt not: then ſaid I, Lo I come, in the Volume of the book it is written of me, that I ſhould do thy will:</hi> as if he had ſaid, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as no other Sacrifices have hitherto been able to Recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile thee unto man: Behold, I thine only begotten Son do offer up my ſelf unto thee for man. And we, Brethren, let us ſtand cloſe to our High Prieſt with great devotion whileſt he offereth himſelf for us; Let us lift up the eyes of our mind, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Sacrifice, and from the bottom of our heart let us ſay, Holy Father, look down (we beſeech thee) from thy Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary and holy Place, and from the height of thy heavenly Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Behold this ſacred Sacrifice and Oblation, which our great High Prieſt thy Holy child Jeſus offereth unto thee for the ſins of his Brethren, and be thou appeaſed for the multitude of our wickedneſs which we have committed. Behold the blood of our brother cryeth to thee from the croſs, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. Behold the ſpotleſs Lamb which was dumb before the ſhearers. Behold he that did no ſin, he hath born and taken away our ſins. Behold
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:171778:208"/> Lord the face of thine Anointed, thy Chriſt, who was obedient to thee, even to the death: and never do thou turn thine eyes away from beholding the marks of his wounds, that thou mayeſt never forget what great and full ſatisfaction thou haſt received from him for our ſins. Look O moſt mercifull Father upon him that doth ſuffer, and remember gracious Father for whom he ſuffereth. Moſt meek Maker, look upon the Humanity of thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Off-ſpring, and take pity on the frailty of thy feeble work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. Have reſpect to the torn members of thy moſt tender and acceptable Progeny; and remember whereof I am made, and what my ſubſtance is. Look upon the penance, and take notice of the ſufferings of God and Man, and relieve the miſery of thy poor creature man. Conſider the Torment of the Redeemer, and forgive the ſin of the Redeemed. And thou alſo, O thou wretched ſinner, ſee the Sacrifice with which thou waſt Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the blood wherewith thou art waſhed; the puniſhment by which thy ſins were ſatisfied for, the bonds by which thou art ſet at liberty. See thoſe hands which diſſolved the wicked works which thy hands had wrought. See the feet which carryed away, what thy feet left behind and offended in by neglect, ſloth, or overmuch haſte and ſwiftneſs. Look upon and into Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in this faſhion: for never was he any where ſeen more love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. His hands are open to give unto thee, his feet are faſt to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with thee, his arms ſpread abroad to receive and embrace thee, his head bowed down to kiſs thee. Take thou heed therefore left that be caſt in thy teeth:
<hi>I have ſpread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa 65. Rom. 10. Again, <hi>I have ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out my hand, and no man regarded,</hi> Prov. 1. See O man, (ſaith Chriſt crying from the croſs) what I do endure for thee? I that do dye for thee, I call and cry unto thee to ſee what puniſhment I ſuffer; Behold, do but ſee with what Nails I am pierced, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Jews</hi> were not content to put Chriſt to a moſt ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full death, in a moſt ignominious place, but to aggravate his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach they muſt crucifie two Thieves with him, not as if they were enemies to the Thieves, for they were partakers of their wickedneſs. For when
<hi>Pilate</hi> ſaid, <hi>Whom will ye that I releaſe?</hi> the Thieves cryed out and asked for a Thief. Now,</p>
               <p n="1">1. They crucified Thieves with the Lord, to ſtain and blemiſh his Paſſion, that ſo he might be taken for an offender, at
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:171778:209"/> leaſt from the wicked companions with which he ſuffered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That their crime might ſeem all one, who ſuffered all alike, and that the report might be blazed abroad, that there were three Thieves crucified at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in one day. This is that which thoſe wicked <hi>Jews</hi> would have. And the more to defame Chriſt, they ſo ſet the croſſes, that Jeſus was placed in the middle, hedged on either hand with Thieves, that all men might take him for the Ring-leader of Thieves, the very Captain of Cutters and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way-men. True, the Law doth not only allow, but command that Thieves ſhould be put to death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.
<hi>Numb.</hi> 35.31. Well, but what hath the Fountain of life done worthy of death? what good hath he omitted that he ought to have done? O
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and thou <hi>Judaea,</hi> is this all he ſhall have from you, who hath done all good to you? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. Is this all the thanks he ſhall have at thy hands, who ever ſince <hi>Abrahams</hi> time hath ſo wonderfully guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaved, exalted and honoured thee above all the people in the world? Who did ever bid thee crucifie thine own Meſſias, King, Biſhop, Doctor or Teacher, Shepheard, Father? Wo be to thee
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for this thy murder, for this thy malice. But thus thou muſt (though unwittingly) fulfill that Propheſie: <hi>And he was numbred with the wicked,</hi> Iſa. 53. Chriſt muſt thus be humbled, that we might be reckoned among the juſt. But all the drift of theſe wicked <hi>Iews</hi> was to diſgrace Chriſt utterly: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it fell out far otherwiſe. For the Fountain of all purity cannot be defiled with humane impurities: for even the villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and filthy acts of men ſerve to ſet off and illuſtrate the clearneſs of the Spring of Glory. The Croſs which formerly was a reproach, is now made a Badge of Triumph by him, the head to which the world boweth, which the Angels worſhip, and at which the Devils tremble. Chriſt when he was condemned among Thieves, found one whom of a Thief he could make a Citizen of Paradiſe; ſo far was he from being polluted by ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering with Malefactors. But,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Chriſt would ſuffer among Thieves, and not among his Diſciples, leſt his death alone ſhould be thought not to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for our ſalvation, unleſs his Diſciples had dyed with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He was crucified with Thieves, becauſe he dyed for thieves. A thief is one that ſteals that which belongeth to God. All we are thieves: therefore is Chriſt crucified in the midſt of us. And
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:171778:209"/> we alſo are crucified; for there is none without his croſs. But as here, one of the thieves is damned, ſo all are not ſaved that bear the croſs. Look to it therefore that thy croſs become thy crown: which it will not be, except thou believe in Chriſt. The two thieves then, whereof the one was ſaved, and the other dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, do ſignifie, Firſt either men or devils; Secondly, either <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> or <hi>Jews:</hi> Thirdly, either good or bad men, both which bear their croſs, but in a different manner.</p>
               <p>Finally, Let us here learn to be raiſed from the earth, and with Chriſt to be crucified in the midſt of thieves. For as then there were three crucified, two thieves, and Jeſus in the middle: ſo there are in us three things morally to be crucified in us, to wit, the fleſh and the world, ſignified by the two thieves, and the Spirit, which is ſignified by Jeſus. The fleſh is to be crucified as the right-hand thief: <hi>For they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts,</hi> Gal. 5.24. We muſt crucifie the world as the left-hand thief:
<hi>The world,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, is crucified unto me, and I unto the world,</hi> Gal. 6.14. When thoſe thieves are crucified in us, then is our ſpirit crucified with Chriſt in the midſt, ſo that we may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt: Nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. As therefore the thief on the left hand was crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed indeed, but not ſaved, for he continued in his unbelief: ſo the world, although it be crucified to me, doth ſtill remain in its filthineſs. But when the fleſh is crucified, it is ſaved with the ſpirit, for it ſhall be glorified in its Reſurrection from the dead. Therefore it is compared to the right-hand thief, to whom it was ſaid,
<hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> Luke 23.</p>
               <p>Now the croſs of the fleſh is the ſeverity of Diſcipline, which hath four branches; Watchfulneſs, Abſtinence, courſe cloaths, or meanneſs of apparel, and well-ordered words, or ſavoury Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. The croſs by which the world is crucified, is poverty of ſpirit: which alſo hath four parts: that is, contempt of glory, gain, countrey, and of Parentage. The croſs of the Spirit is fervency of Devotion: which hath four Arms, Love, Hope, Fear and Grief. Hope above, Fear beneath, Love on the right hand, Grief on the left.

<hi>Then ſaid the chief Prieſts of the</hi> Jews <hi>to</hi> Pilate,
<hi>Write not the King of the</hi> Jews, <hi>but that he ſaid, I am King of the</hi> Jews. Pilate <hi>anſwered, what I have written, I have written.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Croſs was now raiſed, and lifted on high, it ſtood ſtrait upright: Chriſt hung on it, many wept to ſee it, wickedneſs and injuſtice abound, and yet <hi>Pilate</hi> would fain carry the buſineſs without ſuſpition of injuſtice or wrong. And therefore being a ſubtile and crafty man in the worldly Wiſdom; he invents ſome new device, and writeth a Title or ſcroul, wherein he ſignifieth in four words the whole Tragedy, with the crime annexed for which he was thus judged and Executed. For now his conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to twinge him for what he had done, he was afraid that he ſhould be complained upon to <hi>Caeſar</hi> for delivering ſuch and ſo great a man, with whom God appeared to be, to the covetous, greedy, and malicious deſire of the <hi>Jews,</hi> without ſhewing any cauſe or reaſon of ſo doing. And therefore that he might clear himſelf, that what he had done beſides the courſe and order of Law, he did it juſtly and upon weighty reaſons, he feigneth this, becauſe he could not think upon or invent a more hainous Title for his excuſe and defence, relying upon it to be ſaved harmleſs with <hi>Caeſar,</hi> as if he had not put Chriſt to death, as he was the Son of God, or a Prophet of the <hi>Jews,</hi> but as a ſeditious perſon, and an enemy to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> and as one that had a mind and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be King. This he thought would ſecure him, inaſmuch as no power can bear a Competitor. This was <hi>Pilates</hi> intention when he wrote this Title,
<note place="margin">For he was baniſhed and killed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</note> but what ſtead it ſtood him in he very well knew, and had ſufficient experience ſhortly after. But God or the holy Spirit of God intended ſomething elſe: that is, to give unto Chriſt a Name above every name, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. and the Title of a Kingdom, which ſhall laſt when Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth are paſt away; becauſe Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that is, the Saviour and the truly Holy One, is made King of the <hi>Jews</hi> by his ſuffering upon the Croſs: not of thoſe who ſay they are Jews, and are not, <hi>but are the Synagogue of Satan,</hi> Rev.
2. But of thoſe who confeſs and acknowledge God in Truth.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="339" facs="tcp:171778:211"/> In theſe four words, <hi>JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> of
<hi>NAZARETH, KING</hi> of the <hi>JEWS,</hi> the whole effect of the croſs is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Firſt, he is called <hi>Jeſus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1.</note>becauſe having made ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and paid the price of our Redemption, he is become the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our ſalvation. Secondly, he is Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2.</note>that is, flouriſhing or full of Flowers, becauſe the Bloſſoms of his Godlineſs are the Example and Pattern of an honeſt converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto us. He is alſo the Heavenly Odour of that ſweet Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which the Father did ſmell and accept for us. He is the Hope of Eternal fruit, by which we ſhall enjoy the ſweetneſs of his God-head. Thirdly, he is called a <hi>King,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>becauſe of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Guidance. For he doth Rule us in the Life of Grace, and direct us to life of Glory. Chriſt is King in Life and Death, which cannot be ſaid of any other. Fourthly,
<note place="margin">4</note>he is King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> to inform us to whom theſe Benefits do belong: to wit, to thoſe that do confeſs and believe them. Behold, ſuch great Myſteries as theſe hath God opened unto us by ſo vile an Inſtrument as <hi>Pilate</hi> was: which very thing doth ſet forth the wonderful Counſell of God. For he can tell how to turn the counſels of wicked men to his own praiſe and glory.</p>
               <p>This Triumphant Title doth not a little confirm and comfort us that are Chriſtians, who glory in the croſs of Chriſt, and count it our higheſt honour; which Title was not ſet at the feet, but at the head of Chriſt, to ſhew that his Kingdom is not baſe and earthy, but high and Heavenly. For it is, and ever will be moſt true, that this Jeſus which was born in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> and brought up at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> is King of the
<hi>Jews,</hi> their own Prophets being witneſſes, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 2. &amp; 45. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Zach.</hi> 9. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they caſt off their King, we <hi>Gentiles</hi> do joyfully receive him (<hi>Act.</hi> 14.) as King of all, that do acknowledge and confeſs him.
<hi>Pilate</hi> hit the Nail on the head, when he wrote this Title, and reached the very Truth it ſelf, whatever his meaning and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was. And this he would have all people to read &amp; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand: and therefore he wrote it in the three principall and moſt general Languages, which were then, and ſtill are the chiefeſt Languages over all the world, to excuſe himſelf in all Countries and Nations of the death of ſo eminent a man.</p>
               <p>He wrote it in the Hebrew Tongue, becauſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> who made their boaſt of the Law. In the Greek, becauſe of the wiſe
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:171778:212"/> Philoſophers of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And in the Latine, for the <hi>Romans</hi> to read it. Every Kingdom in the World, all the wiſdom of the World, all the Myſteries of Gods Law do witneſs, in ſpite of the <hi>Jews,</hi> whether they will or no, that this Jeſus is King of the <hi>Jews:</hi> that is, he is the chief Ruler and guide of all that confeſs and believe in God.</p>
               <p>All theſe things came to paſs, not ſo much by
<hi>Pilates</hi> contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance as by Gods Providence.
<note place="margin">1.</note>For firſt, God did hereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for all mankind, that all men might know that this was he whom God had anointed King over all Nations, as it is ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. <hi>All people, Nations and Languages ſhall ſerve him.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Paul, At the Name of Ieſus every knee ſhall bow,</hi> Phil. 2.
<note place="margin">2.</note>Secondly, that all Nations might know and underſtand how treacherous and perfideous the <hi>Iews</hi> were, who crucified their own Meſſias.
<note place="margin">3.</note>Thirdly, that even thus it might be known, that Chriſt dyed for all men; whether they be <hi>Iews, Greeks,</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>Fourthly, to ſhew that the Goſpel and the Grace of Chriſt do equally and alike belong to all men, to one as well as another.
<note place="margin">5.</note>And laſtly, that all Languages and every Tongue ſhould glorifie Chriſt, which was then fulfilled, and is ſo now. For in theſe three Tongues the Church alwayes hath had, read, and ſung the Scriptures. <hi>For every Tongue muſt confeſs that Ieſus is the Chriſt, to the Glory of God the Father, Phil.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>But this Title the chief Prieſts of the <hi>Iews</hi> did begrudge Chriſt, and could yet wiſh that it were changed or aboliſhed: but God forbid that <hi>Pilate</hi> ſhould alter the leaſt jot or title of what was written. He had leave enough given him already againſt Chriſt. This Title muſt never be blotted out. The <hi>Iews</hi> were aſhamed that Strangers and Forraigners ſhould read and underſtand this Title. They were afraid leſt one time or other it ſhould be caſt in their teeth, that they had crucified Chriſt their own proper and lawfull King: and therefore they deſire that the title ſhould be altered. Thus wickedneſs is loath to be ſeen when it doth wickedly, but would fain palliate and cloak its naughtineſs. But <hi>Pilate</hi> had not reſpect to their infamy and diſgrace, but to his own ſafety, when he ſet up that Title: and therefore would not change it. But if he did write that Title contrary to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, yet nevertheleſs our Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth</hi> would have been King not only of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but of all other people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:171778:212"/> For he had not his Kingly Name from
<hi>Pilates</hi> inſcription, but from the will and calling of the Father, who anointed him thereunto. But as thoſe things which Chriſt had ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Kingdom did ſtill continue ſo ſpoken: ſo what
<hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> had written, remained ſtill written. And truly,
<hi>Pilate</hi> among ſo many errours of fickleneſs and cowardize, yet in this one thing he did well, not to alter the Title. For there could be no truer title written on the croſs of Chriſt then this. It concerns us to make good uſe of that title. Tis not enough to write it on our walls, unleſs we write it alſo in our hearts. Wherefore if any miſery or misfortune trouble thee, remember that Jeſus is thy King and thine Avenger, and thou ſhalt not want relief or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. If thou art a ſinner, conſider that Jeſus is he who ſaved his people from their ſins, and thou wilt be incouraged againſt thy ſins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It follows in the Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then the Souldiers, when they had crucified Jeſus,
<note place="margin">John 19.23.</note> took his Garments, and made four parts, to every Souldier a part, and alſo his coat: now the coat was without ſeam, woven from the top thorowout. They ſaid therefore among themſelves, Let us not rent it, but caſt Lots for it, whoſe it ſhall be, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, which ſaith, They parted my Rayment among them, and for my Veſture they did caſt Lots. And ſitting down, they watched him there,</hi> Mat. 27.36. <hi>Theſe things therefore the Souldiers did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When our moſt holy Lord was ſuffering on the croſs, the Souldiers (juſt as hangmen uſe to do) hale and pull his cloaths off him: and becauſe they had power given them to put him to death when he was condemned, they had leave alſo to take his cloaths when he was dead: although it may be ſuppoſed that Chriſts cloaths could do thoſe Souldiers but little good, ſo that they divided them rather out of a cuſtom to ſatisfie their luſts, then for any advantage they made of them.</p>
               <p>Thus our Lord Jeſus was ſo proſcribed, and all that he had, openly ſet to ſale as an offender and guilty perſon, that he could not ſo much as diſpoſe of his own cloaths to his deareſt friends, who would carefully have laid them up, and kept them charily as a great Treaſure. But when his body was brim full of reproaches, revilings, and abuſes, he was content that the hangmen ſhould have his cloaths for their pains. All which was done,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:171778:213"/> 1. That the Scriptures might be fulfilled,

                  </hi> 22. For
<hi>David</hi> plainly foretold this, that it ſhould ſo be: Not only the more remarkable things of Chriſt, but alſo the ſmalleſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances were foretold of him in the Scriptures, that by all alike we might be led into the very truth it ſelf, and be kept from errour by one, as well as by another. And truly it is a great Teſtimony to our faith, that the Propheſies of all the Prophets were ſo clearly and plainly fulfilled in our
<hi>Nazarite.</hi> The Jews are never able to find out any other man in all the world, in whom the whole Scripture doth ſo meet and agree.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This diviſion of Chriſts cloaths was to ſignifie and ſet forth a Myſterie, and to ſhew how it would be in time to come For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Garments of Chriſt do ſignifie the holy Scriptures, which heady and raſh Hereticks rent and tear into divers and various ſenſes. For wicked men will take nothing out of the Scripture, but what will ſerve their turn beſt, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to hold the Truth of God by parts and parcels, and ſo the Devil will own and keep to Scripture,
<note place="margin">Mat. 4.</note> if he may be allowed to pick and chuſe as he lift. And whereas the Lord had more than one Garment, it ſignifieth the many volumes of the Scriptures with which the Word of God is clad. The ſeamleſs coat doth fitly ſet forth one intire, inviolable Catholick Faith, which thoſe heretical ſouldiers could not rent, cut and aboliſh, yet they would caſt lots for it. Hereticks do not deny Faith and the Goſpel, but they do ſo play with the Scripture, and darken it with ſuch obſcure words, dead and dallying gloſſes, that one can hardly find and know Chriſt by it. Or more properly thus:</p>
               <p>The four parts of Chriſts cloaths ſignifie the Church, which is parted into four parts, extending to the four parts of the world, and yet is, and ever will be but one. The ſeamleſs coat which was not divided, ſignifieth the unity of all the parts, which is bound about with the girdle of Charity. If this Unity be once diſſolved, the rent is ſtill made wider, and the Schiſm waxeth greater, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith.
<hi>But lots are caſt for this coat, for all men have not faith.</hi> All run indeed, but one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth the prize, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. Hereticks endeavour to rend this Unity, and thereby cut themſelves off from the Church, but yet the Unity of faith ſtill hath, and ever will be the ſame.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="343" facs="tcp:171778:213"/> 2. The Garment of Chriſt is his humanity, which is diſtributed and preached over the four parts of the world, and is, and hath been ſo publiſhed and divulged, that wicked men are not able to conceal or hide it any longer.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſts cloaths are temporal goods, and theſe alſo he doth freely beſtow upon wicked men, yea, he doth ſuffer them to ſnatch them off, and ſcrape, and rake them to themſelves. But ſpirituall things he doth bequeath and give to the godly, and with them he doth beſtow himſelf alſo upon them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Saints and good men are the Garments of Chriſt, who cleave and keep cloſe to Chriſt, as 'tis propheſied of them: As the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man; <hi>So have I cauſed to cleave unto me the whole houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 13.11. By the parting of Chriſts rayment, the nature and property of the world is ſignified, and how it doth deal with the godly in this life. For good men ſeem to lye open wholly to the will and pleaſure of evil men in this world: but for all that Chriſts coat is rent, that is, although the godly are derided and toſſed up and down in the world, yet they are not deſtroyed, nor totally rooted out. The Evangeliſt doth emphatically add this in the caſe, <hi>Theſe things therefore the ſouldiers did:</hi> with which word he ſhutteth up and concludeth all that they did. The Souldiers ſaith he, <hi>did theſe things;</hi> and what more they ſhould do, they could not well tell. They had crucified his body, and taken the prey; but the Power of God, the Word of God they could not deſtroy. And whom may thoſe ſouldiers, who did cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Chriſt, and yet ſtrove might and main who ſhould wear his cloaths, whom, I ſay, do they more properly ſignifie than thoſe wicked and ungodly high Prieſts, who were more truly ſouldiers, than high Prieſts? For they neglected to ſearch, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret, expound, and open the Scriptures, they ſleighted prayer and works of piety, they caſt off the cure and care of ſouls, they give themſelves to nothing but to raiſe and foment war to maintain their great vaſt eſtates and large poſſeſſions, and moſt ſuperfluous wealth, they ſhed blood, and make nothing to mingle all things, and ſtain them with war and ſlaughter. They divide Churches and Benefices among themſelves, which ought to be for the maintenance of thoſe that preach the Word, and they have not every man one, but ſome two, three, yea, ten Benifices
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:171778:214"/> apeice. Now they caſt lots, that is, they chop and change, fell, give to their Kindred, and infinite other monſtrous things they do, to the ſubverſion of Laws, Juſtice, Goſpel, and all honeſty. Chriſt looks on all the while, and ſaith nothing, but he will not always hold his peace. <hi>Theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>haſt thou done, and I kept ſilence:</hi> thou thoughtſt that I was altogether ſuch a one as thy ſelf, but thou art much miſtaken, <hi>I will reprove thee, and ſet them in order before thine eyes,</hi> Pſalm 50. Let every man there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look to it, how he doth diſpoſe the goods of the Church, the cloaths of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It follows:</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>And the people ſtood beholding.

If thou be the Son of God, come down from the Croſs. Likewiſe alſo the chief Prieſts, mocking him among themſelves, with the Scribes and Elders of the people, ſaid, He ſaved others, himſelf he cannot ſave. If he be the King of Iſrael, let him now come down from the Croſs; if he be the Chriſt, the choſen of God, let him ſave himſelf, that we may ſee, and believe him. He truſted in God, let him deliver him now if he will have him. For he ſaid, I am the Son of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hitherto you have had Charity and Patience to hear what puniſhment and pain the innocent and moſt meek Lamb hath ſuffered. Now you hear that after and above all that was foretold, he is here ſet upon and aſſaulted in his ſufferings with revilings, reproaches, mockings, evil ſpeakings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for when they could no longer buffet and ſpit upon him, they invade and vex him with their taunting tongues. The world will omit no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may add affliction to the Elect of God; for they are not of the world, therefore doth the world hate them. Chriſt had many taunts, jeers and ſcoffs caſt on him in <hi>Caiaphas</hi>'s houſe; and yet there is no end of them. Here firſt whilſt he hangs on the Croſs, they raiſe and invent a new, and that ſo deviliſh a ſcorn of him that a greater and more bitter one could hardly be imagined. Firſt, Therefore obſerve here who it was that did this. Secondly, How and wherefore they did it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Firſt, I ſay they were the chief Prieſts that did this. 2. The Scribes. 3. The Elders. 4. The Souldiers. 5. The Thieves. 6. All the people that went by the Croſs. And what Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:171778:214"/> was there in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that did not do it, the Elect only and Believers excepted? Is it not a great, fearfull and unſpeakable miſery, that ſo many men both of high and low degree, ſhould ſo bitterly, ſo inhumanely, ſo venomouſly, ſo odiouſly mock him, who never did or ſaid any thing in the leaſt that was ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, or to be laughed at; but did rather both do and ſay all things moſt praiſe worthy; and deſerving the higheſt commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations? But thus, and no otherwiſe doth the Power of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs do.</p>
               <p n="2">2. See now why and wherefore they do thus inhumanely deride Chriſt in his greateſt extremity: for this mocking doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend all thoſe things of which he was accuſed at firſt, both before
<hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and <hi>Herod.</hi> And they were four, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. He is mocked and reviled for that which they had object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt him concerning the deſtruction and building again of the Temple; which although in Truth he did never ſay as they alledged, yet he muſt hear it, for they tell him of it without any pitty, and now too, in his greateſt diſtreſs, when he was at the point of death. But however, O ye mad Jews, as ye have moſt hatefully upbraided him, ſo it muſt, and was to be done, and now it is accompliſht, and was ſo long ſince. In three days the Temple of his body was reared up again, which ye deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not he. What pardon then can you expect, or what admiſſion can ye look for, when ye ſhall ſee the Temple of God built again within three days in the reſurrection of the body?</p>
               <p n="2">2. He is flouted at for being the Son of God; as if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had not been the Son of God, becauſe he was crucified. But that he is ſo, was ſufficiently proved both in himſelf, and by many thouſand men, whom he cured either in body, or ſoul, or both.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They laugh at him about his being a King, and concerning the Kingdom of Iſrael. But do what ye can, this is he that was, and is King of Iſrael, nor have all your ſcoffs and taunts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted or abated one jot of his royal Majeſty and Dignity. Yet God forbid that he ſhould have come down from the Croſs to ſhew that he was able to make it good. This is that which the devil did long for, and would have been glad to ſee, and

But if thou wouldſt, O Jew, be aſſured by ſome token only, that he is the King of Iſrael indeed, conſider either his former Miracles with the agreement of the Scriptures and times, or elſe look for him on the day of his Reſurrection, then thou ſhalt ſee ſomething more, thou ſhalt then ſee him ſpring and mount out of the grave like a Conqueror; which certainly is much more than if he had now come down from the Croſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4. They jeer at him for ſaying, that he was Chriſt and the true Meſſias; which is moſt true that he was, ſtill is, and ever will be. And that which he did many ways prove to be true both in your own Country, and in all the world beſides, ſo that never any did, or ever ſhall do the like. From this Chriſt it is that we are called Chriſtians, nor are we aſhamed of the name. And whereas ye ſay that he healed and ſaved others, you do thereby plainly confeſs that he is the Saviour. So that out of your own mouth are ye condemned.</p>
               <p>All theſe things did thoſe wicked men do, that they might not only ſtain and blemiſh, but wholly pluck up by the roots, and extirpate out of the hearts of all men all the good Report, Doctrine, Authority, Reputation and Miracles of Chriſt, and on the contrary, deeply imprint, and inwardly faſten this weakneſs of Chriſt in the rude people, that the memory of him might be totally blotted out, as if they had ſaid, Good people ye all now ſee, that he was a plain Deceiver, for he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo much as ſave himſelf: How much leſs can he do any thing for you? Now therefore be no longer ſeduced, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve us, and not him. You ſee that he doth now hang on the Tree, which could never be, if he were not accurſed of God:
<hi>For curſed is every one that hangeth on a Tree.</hi> And therefore he cannot truſt in God, nor will God deliver him. Thus they thought that they had caſheir'd and cancel'd all his Miracles, and made them of none effect, ſo that none would dare hereafter ſo much as lightly remember or make mention of them. This they did moſt earneſtly deſire to do, and to accompliſh it, they rage ſo inhumanely againſt him. This kind of deriſion is ſpoken of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:171778:216"/> in many <hi>Pſalms: Many,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there be that ſay of my ſoul, there is no help for him in his God,</hi> Pſalm 3.2.

               <p>But Oye Jews, you work in the fire, you waſh a Blackmoor, you do but labour in vain, in going about to ſuppreſs and extinguiſh the Renown and Glory of Chriſt. For by how much the more ye curtail and leſſen the Authority of Chriſt, ſo much the greater will it grow. You mocked him before <hi>Caiaphas, Pilate, Herod,</hi> and now ye do the like as ye paſs by, ſtand, and ſit under the Croſs, and what, O ye malicious men, have ye omitted, and not done that might any ways tend to darken and ecclipſe his honour? for ye apprehended him as a Thief, ye manicled him as one condemned of ſome notorious villany; ye ſpit on him, and at him, as if he had been a poyſonous Toad; ye deſired the Judge to put him to death without any more ado, as one that was not fit to have ſo much as an accuſation brought againſt him; beſides ye prefer'd the egregious Thief
<hi>Barabbas</hi> before him; ye made him carry his own Croſs; ye hanged him naked in the midſt of Thieves, in a filthy, loathſome baſe place, at a moſt ſolemn, ſacred and feſtival time, in the view of a huge multitude of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: ye envyed him any Title or Badge of Honour, and now ye beſpatter him with all the baſe Reproaches and bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilings that ye can poſſibly deviſe and imagine. But your wickedneſs is confounded, your deſign is blaſted, you have not prevailed. He is ſaved from his enemies, and from the hands of all that hated him. By how much the more you ſleighted and deſpiſed him, ſo much the more did the Father glorifie him. For the Cup which you denyed him, he hath obtained the Heritage of all the heathen, of all Nations and people: and when ye lifted him up from the earth, he drew all things unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12. For the honour which ye thought to darken and extinguiſh, he now ſitteth at the right hand of the Father; all Power in Heaven and in Earth is given to him; he is made Judge both of quick and dead.</p>
               <p>Note that there are five ſorts of men here pointed out,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:171778:217"/> who then did, and now ſtill do mock and deride Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The firſt are, <hi>They that paſſed by,</hi> they that go by, paſs over, or tread beſides the Law and Commandments of God, that walk in the way and counſell of the ungodly. The light is odious and offenſive to the ſick and ſore eyes, and he that is troubled with an Ague cannot relliſh or taſte the ſweetneſs of moſt delicate dainties.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Princes and Rulers,</hi> who eſteemed Chriſt no better then the vileſt thing in the world, they cannot indure to hear him, they have tender ears, ſoon offended, quickly wounded, yea they are wounded and hurt with a touch; they were always bred and brought up among fawning fellows, they uſe to be ſhaved with the ſmooth tongued Razors of flatterers, and to be bolſtred and propt up with the ſoft pillows of Paraſites, ſuch as theſe they love, cheriſh, hug, imbrace and beſtow the higheſt preferment that may be upon them. But if a righteous man come among them, and admoniſh them exhort to Repentance, and preach the Truth freely; he is loathed, hiſſed at, beaten, whipt, impriſoned,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nature is indeed a ſtate or condition that hath a love to Truth written in the breaſts of all men: all men by Nature are convinced that Truth is a lovely thing, but this ſtate of nature, and the deſire of hearing the truth is too much depraved, diverted and corrupted in moſt men. They commend and ſpeak well of the Truth, they feign and profeſs that they have a perfect love to the Preachers of it, but yet they cannot, they will not, they love not to hear the Truth. Like <hi>Herod,</hi> they love to hear
<hi>John</hi> preach, but at the requeſt of a dancing Damſel, they will chop off his head, <hi>Mar.</hi> 6. They like the ſound of a tinkling Cymbal, but their head is ſo weak, they cannot ſit to hear it out. Such were the Rulers of the Jews. But wo be to thee O Land, whoſe Princes are thoſe boyes that ſcoffed (not without puniſhment) at the bald head of
<hi>Eliſha,</hi> 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The Prieſts and Phariſees,</hi> who although they ſeemed to reverence Righteouſneſs, (for they pray publiquely, Tythe Mynt and Cummin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) yet none ſin more licenciouſly, nor dare any reprove their evil manners. Do not they mock Chriſt, who practiſe not what they preach, and lay heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens upon others not to be born, <hi>But themſelves will not touch
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:171778:217"/> them with one of their fingers?</hi> Mar.
23. Are not they ſcoffers at the Divine Majeſty, who come from the ſtews and half-peny harlots, and yet preſs with unwaſhed hands (that is, without repentance for their ſins) unto the ſervice and Table of the Lord? Obſcene and filthy fellows dare preſume to come to the Altar, and ſtand before the Virgin-like and pure Jeſus, with criſped and frizled locks before the crucified one, ſinners before the ſevereſt Judge, who not long after, even preſently return again to their whoredoms and adulteries. Are not theſe mockers, yea Traytors of Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth ſort of ſcoffers at Chriſt, are the thieves. Theſe are covetous men, who by hook and crook ſcrape up and heap to themſelves the goods of the poor, by uſury, theft, fraud,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> carking and caring both in getting and keeping their wealth: theſe deride and laugh at good men, counting their life madneſs, and their end to be without honour, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 2. They neither diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe nor diſtribute what is their own as they ought to do: nor do they reſtore what they have unjuſtly and wrongfully got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, till at laſt they are ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ked with the thorns of their Riches.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Souldiers are a fifth ſort of Mockers, ſuch as ſhed mans blood, who are given to ſport and pleaſures, wrathfull and voluptuous, frolick and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the cloaths of Chriſt: to wit, temporal proſperity but yet crucifie him; that is, they loſe their eternal ſalvation, perſecute good men, and warm themſelves with the ſpoiles of the godly. But while they riot it out in ſport and paſtime, and ſpend their dayes in wealth, in a moment they go down to the grave, <hi>Iob</hi> 21.13. The whole world is full of this kind of men, who mock and deride Chriſt. We muſt not therefore lay all the blame upon the <hi>Jews</hi> only.</p>
               <p>Here alſo we may obſerve, that in this mocking of Chriſt there are five kinds of temptations hinted out to us, which uſually ſet upon the godly, eſpecially at their death.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As Chriſt was faſtened to the croſs, and hung naked upon it in the ſight of all men, ſo the firſt temptation when we are a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that the ſhame of all our life will be ſeen and made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to all the creatures.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As Chriſt was not
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ed by one or two, or many only, but by all, both great and ſmall, high and low; ſo the ſecond
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:171778:218"/> temptation of a dying man is, that all the creatures will laugh at the whole Scene and ſtory of our Life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As they nodded their heads at Chriſt, and endeavoured to over throw all that he had ſpoken: ſo the third temptation of the godly is, when they are terrified with the moſt powerfull ſayings of the Holy Scripture, ſuch as theſe: <hi>We muſt give an account of every idle word,</hi> Mat. 12. And, <hi>God heareth not ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. Joh.
9.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As it was ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Let God deliver him, if he will have him:</hi> ſo the fourth temptation of the godly is, when they are tempted to queſtion the will and pleaſure of their good God. For there is a great Emphaſis in the word HIM: <hi>Let him deliver Him,</hi> ſay they, <hi>if he will have him.</hi> Who doubts but that God doth know how, and is able and willing to ſave? For God is a God of ſalvation, <hi>Pſal</hi>
68.20. But whether or no he <hi>would</hi> ſave Him, this is that which the Devil would make doubtfull, eſpecially if a man live among wicked men, as Chriſt died among thieves. It is a great temptation, when the Devil ſhall make a man that profeſſeth the Goſpel to doubt, that although he believeth that Chriſt is <hi>Our</hi> Righteouſneſs, yet to queſtion whether he will be <hi>His</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Laſtly. As it was ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, ſave thy ſelf,</hi> &amp;c. So the greateſt temptation of dying men is, <hi>Predeſtination.</hi> Wherefore that we may overcome theſe tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we muſt be dumb and deaf to all, after the Example of Chriſt, who replyed not a word to theſe railings and reproaches. Thus thoſe three children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. ſaid, <hi>We are not carefull to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer thee in this matter,</hi> when that wicked King ſaid, <hi>Who is that God that ſhall deliver you out of my hands? God is able,</hi> ſay they, <hi>to deliver us.</hi> Thus men ought to commit all the buſineſs to God, and caſt all their care on him, whether they be predeſtinated, or not. Do not pry into the Majeſty of God, leſt thou be cruſhed with his Glory. Hence ſaith <hi>Iſaiah, In quietneſs and in confidence ſhall be your ſtrength,</hi> Iſa. 30.15. And <hi>Jeremy, It is good that a man ſhould both hope, &amp; quietly wait for the ſalvation of the Lord,</hi> Lam. 3.26. Therefore turn the deaf ear to all theſe Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, eſpecially to that Temptation of Predeſtination. Give glory to God, glorifie Him, and he will glorifie thee: and be not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoughtfull of Predeſtination.</p>
               <trailer>Now follow the Seven laſt Words of Chriſt.</trailer>
            </div>

               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:171778:218"/>
               <head>Here beginneth the fourth Part of the Paſsion of our Lord.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Itherto it hath been ſhewed what Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Let us now bear the cloſe of all, and how he finiſhed his Paſſion. And here let us give all attention. For as godly Parents, when they are at the point of death, do at that laſt hour eſpecially inculcate, and preſs upon their children thoſe things which are moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and profitable for them, that they may take the deeper impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſtick the faſter in their minds. For the laſt words are thought to come next from the heart, and fit cloſeſt to the mind: So our moſt loving Chriſt, call him either Father or Brother, when he lay upon his hard death-bed of the Croſs, and was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to yield up the ghoſt. He doth firſt ſet his houſe in order, make his Will, ordain Laws for his Family, diſcharge all Debts, appoint his co-Heirs, diſtribute and diſpoſe of all his Treaſure, And therefore they that fear to be diſ-inherited, let them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently learn and underſtand what the commands of their dying
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:171778:219"/> Saviour are, leſt they never know them; let them not deſpiſe him, leſt he reject and paſs them by,
<hi>Prov.</hi> 1. But let them hear and obey him faithfully, quickly ſubmit to him out of hand, and not forget the Grace and Favour of the Teſtator: I ſay, let them hear the inſtruction of Chriſt their Father, as the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Let them hear not the dotings of a crazy man, but hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Oracles:</hi> Not the voyce of a man only, but of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Let them give ear to the very Truth, which can neither deceive, nor be deceived. Let them hearken to thoſe things which they will never repent the hearing of. For that Fountain of Wiſdom, the Heavenly Organ and Inſtrument Chriſt, being now about to leave the World, and to go hence to the Father through that rough and craggy way of the croſs, did firſt ſalute his elect ones with the moſt pregnant and pithy ſpeech of all that ever he made to them: and what ever he had taught them before, he doth now make repetition of, and ſums it all up together in a moſt effectual Epilogue or after-ſpeech: which though it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in very few words, either becauſe his immenſe and extream Dolours diſabled him, or becauſe our dulneſs diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him, yet was it by much the moſt pleaſant and profitable ſpeech of all, and pronounced with that gravity, that nothing which any man could deſire was omitted or left out. If you look for ſtability and Fortitude, he roareth like a terrible Lyon: If you love to hear a more broken complaint, a more ſobbing and dolefull commiſeration, and a clear ſign of ſorrow, here is the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation as it were of Dragons, and the mourning of Oſtriges. If you would rather have a pleaſant Melody, he doth ſweetly warble it out, like a Swan that is about to dye: If you ſeek for tenderneſs of love, no mother ſo mild, ſo gentle, ſo indulgent: If you want comfort, here are ye disburdened of your ſins, and whatſoever ſeparated is ſafely diſpoſed of. Doſt thou fear like a ſlave to be puniſhed for them? Behold the puniſhment is taken away. Art thou afraid to be diſ-inherited as an hireling? Lo, here is a Thief received into Paradiſe. Finally, If thou doſt thirſt after, and long for pregnant and full Sentences, plenty and abundance of moſt wholeſome Precepts, or the very Fountain it ſelf of all Knowledge; then come hither and draw near to it: here is brought to remembrance all that ever Chriſt taught at any time: Here we are taught what to pray for, what to ſear,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:171778:219"/> what to hope for, what to do, what to avoid. And that which thou ſhalt never find any where elſe; here is a Doctor who at the ſame inſtant alſo infuſeth what he teacheth: one that root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out Vice, and planteth Vertue, that chaſeth away errour, ſparkleth out the light of Faith, inkindleth Charity, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all the gifts of Grace: ſo that a man would wonder that ſo great a Treaſure ſhould lye hid under ſo few words, and that ſeven drops ſhould cauſe ſuch mighty floods to flow from them. But here that of <hi>David</hi> is fulfilled, <hi>The Voyce of the Lord is pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull, the Voyce of the Lord is full of Majeſty,</hi> Pſalm 29. And that of <hi>Paul, The Word of God is quick and powerfull, and ſharper then any two-edged ſword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and ſpirit, and of the joynts and marrow,</hi> Heb. 4.12. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is of God, let him hear, keep, honour, and reverence theſe words of God. Let the ears hear the words of him that created them, let man keep thoſe words that will preſerve him, let man honour thoſe words from which mans Salvation doth ariſe. Chriſt would be lifted up high in the ayr,
<note place="margin">1.</note>that all might ſee and behold him: He lifted up his Voyce like a Trumpet,
<note place="margin">2.</note>that all might hear him: He choſe
<hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3.</note>that famous City in all the Eaſt, to ſhew ſuch great Myſteries in, that from thence his ſound might go forth into all the earth,
<note place="margin">4.</note>and his words unto the ends of the world, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 19. Laſtly, He would ſuffer on the <hi>Jews</hi> Feaſt-day, in a wide and open place without the City, before ſuch an Aſſembly of ſo many Citizens, ſo many Forraigners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo many of ſo many ſeveral Tongues, that the ſo great Myſterie of his Paſſion and farewell Speech might not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from any of any Countrey, State, Language, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Grace of God certainly is not in us, nay we do very wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, and therefore Wo be to us, if either with <hi>Peter</hi> we betake us to our heels and run away from Chriſt, or with the <hi>Jews</hi> fall a ſcoffing at him, or with the Souldiers crucifie him: and not with
<hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin-Mother of God, and <hi>John</hi> the
<hi>Evangeliſt,</hi> we haſten with all ſpeed to this Sermon, ſtanding at the foot of the croſs, attentively liſtening, hearkening with all diligence: and let us treaſure up thoſe golden Words in a broken heart. We are Chriſtians, whither ſhall we go, but to that Maſter who hath the words of Life? <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. By whom can we better ſtand, to whom can we more juſtly cleave, then to Chriſt our Lord and Friend
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:171778:220"/> hanging on the croſs? And if the very Heathen obſerve and keep thoſe commands as religious, holy, and almoſt divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, which are given in charge by parents and friends upon their death-beds: how much more ſtrictly ought we to mark and obſerve theſe laſt words of Chriſt, and faſten them moſt deeply in our breaſts? For our greateſt and chiefeſt Philoſophie is, <hi>To know Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. For there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Righteouſneſs to be had; there is plenty of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, there is the very Truth of Wiſdom, there all our Riches, Righteouſneſs, Merits, Mercies, Salvation, Life and Reſurrection do conſiſt. Thus much by way of Preface. Now let us hear eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Word by it ſelf.</p>
               <div n="1" type="word">
                  <head>Of the firſt Word, <hi>viz.</hi> Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</head>
                  <p>WHen the Lord Jeſus became that true and only Sacrifice, and when he was now about to finiſh the work of our Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and Salvation, although he lay under the preſſure of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable diſtreſs and miſery, yet he did not forget why, and for whom he ſuffered ſuch Torments, even for our ſakes; for which cauſe he went out to meet his Fathers wrathfull diſpleaſure with his prayers, as not minding his own pain and puniſhment; he ſets upon the Work and Office: he begins to take the work of a Prieſt in hand: he ſtands in the place of a Mediator between God and man, he becomes an Interceſſor, a Protector for us, and puts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly as an invincible wall to withſtand the Fathers anger. For he could not poſſibly but remember his native and inbred goodneſs. And therefore when others did curſe, blaſpheme and bitterly revile, he doth pray and make Supplications, not for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for others; and not for others only, but for his moſt cruel enemies and crucifiers, who yet were indeed moſt worthy to be deſtroyed and devoured with fire from Heaven, or that the earth ſhould ſwallow them up alive.

It is all one, as if Chriſt had ſaid, O Father, I am thy Son begotten out of the womb of thine own Subſtance, before Lucifer or the morning Star, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 110.

It is my part and office to interpoſe and ſtand between thy moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous diſpleaſure, and the hainous ſins of man: It lyeth on me, and tis my work to piece up, make whole and firm, reduce, bring back, and Redeem m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

It is committed and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in charge to me to Reconcile both the things that are in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that are in earth. At thy beck and command I came forth from thee, and came into the world, whom thou haſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed and made the Mediator, and the Peace-maker, a Prieſt, and Interceſſor.

So that I am neither coy nor ſtrange to man that doth deſire thy Grace, nor unequal, or inferiour to thee who art the giver of all Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Beſides, I am the fitteſt Prieſt, the worthieſt High Prieſt of any, for I am holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners. <hi>I am made higher then the Heavens,</hi> Heb. 7. I pay that I never had, I have no need to ſtart or ſhrink back from reconciling my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: no man hath any thing againſt me none can lay ought to my charge, no not thou Father, nor yet theſe my Brethren which crucifie me: I have wronged none, I owe no man a farthing, I poſſeſs no mans eſtate, I am out of debt to all the world, I have no need to make ſatisfaction or offer Sacrifice for my ſelf. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I enter the Holy place, bearing the Golden Cenſer, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying much incenſe of prayers; I lay down a price for many of

For certain I am, never any whole burnt offering came up before thee more holy, more acceptable, more ſucceſsfull then this. Wherefore, O Father, I knowing thy mercies very well, that they are over all thy works, in the midſt of theſe very Sacrifices I come forth to meet thee with ſtrong crying and tears, in Faith nothing doubting, I humbly crave, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech, intreat, and beg this at thy hands; pardon thy people, ſpare thy people, blot out the iniquity of thy people with this my blood,

Our own people alſo, whom we have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen out of all Nations, hath committed a great and grievous ſin, in tormenting me thy only Son with ſo many and ſo great Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they little regard whether I be thine, or do belong to thee or no, although I am about to give a clear Teſtimony, &amp; make full proof of it: to which one crime and horrid offence, if all their other villanous acts, and all the reſt of their wicked deeds were compared, they would ſeem as little as nothing. How great is thy Majeſty which is deſpiſed? and my Dignity which is derid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? That people deſpiſeth both, and do heap up horrible iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to their Fathers Tranſgreſſions. I acknowledge thy wrath hath hitherto juſtly raged; by the offence of that one <hi>Adam</hi> Heaven was juſtly ſhut up, the jaws of Hell opened, and death entered into the world: Thou haſt juſtly armed the Heavens and all the Elements for vengeance againſt ſinners: juſtly hath fire from Heaven burnt up ſome alive: juſtly hath the diſtemper of the ayr and the peſtilence deſtroyed others: juſtly hath the Sea over flown and drowned others, with all the encreaſe of the fruit of their Land: juſtly hath the earth with open mouth devoured others. Righteous art thou, and juſt are thy Judgements. In Juſtice thou mighteſt have continued thy diſpleaſure, till thou hadſt utterly deſtroyed and exacted the utmoſt farthing for full ſatisfaction. And if all the men that ever yet lived to this very day had never ſo profuſely and prodigally laviſhed out all their blood, they could not have expiated or blotted out the leaſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:171778:221"/> Such and ſo great is the weight and hainouſneſs of the unſpeakable wickedneſs, that no man could make ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for it, but God; and none ought to have done it, but man, who had ſinned. Now I am he, I am God, and I am man; In me only the whole ſalvation of man dependeth. For that cauſe I became an exile in a ſtrange Country, I have been wearied and tired out with cold, heat, hunger, thirſt, nakedneſs, watchings, wearineſs; I have been tempted, oppreſſed, afflicted. What pains, what torments have I not endured in this poor, ſlender, thin body? What ſorrows, what ſtraits, what diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances and perplexity of mind have I not had experience of? Was there ever any ſorrow like to this of mine, when there is no ſoundneſs from the ſole of the foot to the crown of the head? What remaineth therefore, O Father, but that thou lay aſide thy anger, appeaſe thy diſeleaſure, abate thy wrath, forgive them, take pitty on them, pour out the abundance of thy Graces upon them, ſeeing I have, and do make ſuch abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant ſatisfaction for them? I invocate and pray unto thee as a Father, not as a Judge; I intreat thee not to puniſh, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, for my blood doth not cry for vengeance, as
<hi>Abels</hi> did, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 4.) unleſs happily there ſhall be any that will not be ſaved by it. I have forgiven them already, who am now tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured for them; do thou alſo pardon them, whom that thou migheſt pardon, thou didſt of purpoſe ſend me into the world.</p>
                  <p>Forgive <hi>Them,</hi> thoſe that are thine own,
<note place="margin">Them.</note> whom thou didſt promiſe to have mercy upon before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, whom thou wilt alſo call and ſanctifie in time. Of which number are theſe that have crucified me, and not only theſe <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, and Jews, and the reſt of the Standers by, but all men in the world beſides. <hi>Alam</hi> crucifieth me, who ſinned in Paradiſe. <hi>David</hi> crucifieth me, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended in
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Every man crucifieth me, for there is not a man but is a ſinner. I ſupplicate for all, I ſuffer for all, I ſacrifice for all, do thou pardon and forgive all, that by my death it may appear, that neither thou nor I do deſire the death of ſinners, but rather that they ſhould be converted and live. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. But in a more ſpecial way of love I beſeech thee for thoſe my honeſt plain hearted Brethren, for whoſe ſakes thy
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:171778:222"/> pleaſure was that I ſhould be made a Gentile; forgive them this grievous Crime: The Fact I cannot excuſe. I confeſs they have ſinned moſt exceedingly, yet this I muſt plead for them, that their mind was not ſo abominably miſchievous.</p>

Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe forgive the reſt too, for they alſo know not what they do, for all that work iniquity have been, and are deceived: In <hi>Adam</hi> they did proudly deſire to know as much as we, juſtly therefore are they become as ignorant as the bruit beaſts. Have reſpect therefore to the ſacrifice of thy Son, that holy ſacrifice, which I the great high Prieſt offer unto thee, that unſpotted oblation which I preſent thee withall.

                  <p>This was the firſt word of Chriſt, this his prayer for us, of which <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 5.) that he prayed with tears and ſtrong cryings, and was heard for the reverence which he ſhewed.

                  <p>Learn we then from this firſt word to confeſs and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge our fins. For we are the firſt, true and principal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of Chriſts death, and he doth mean and intend us all when he ſaith,
<hi>Forgive them,</hi> &amp;c. For thoſe ſouldiers were our ſouldiers, even the Officers or Servants of our ſins, who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that upon him which our ſins had deſerved. But who did then know, or doth now think, that our ſins ſhould crucifie the Son of God? yet is it that which <hi>Paul</hi> plainly affirmeth, ſpeaking of ſome, who crucifie Chriſt afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. And this is that of which we are yet too ignorant, how great he is that is offended, and how grievous the ſin committed is, both as to the offence, and alſo to the condemnation. And becauſe theſe things are hid from our eyes, we do not indeed know what we do when we ſin.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt, Then this word teacheth, that we are the Crucifiers of Chriſt, and ſuch as know not God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us from this word ſtrengthen our faith. For if Chriſt did ſo fervently pray for them that crucified him, how much rather doth he now intercede for thoſe that call upon him, and believe in him? If he were ſo ready to forgive a ſin committed againſt his own perſon, he will much more readily forgive us. We may therefore boldly now draw nigh unto God, as having a Patron and an Advocate for us. We may now avoid the wrath of God, and dwell under the Protection of the God of Heaven, <hi>under the ſhadow of the Almighty,</hi> Pſalm 91. <hi>For
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:171778:223"/> God is our Refuge and Strength,</hi> Pſalm 46. Hence is that of <hi>Paul, We ſhall he ſaved from wrath through him,</hi> Rom. 5.9. Again, <hi>We have acceſs through him unto the Father,</hi> Eph. 2.18. And that of <hi>John, But if we ſin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our ſins,</hi> 1 John 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From this word we may learn true Charity, as well to ſerve the good of our Neighbours, as Chriſt ſerved us by his Paſſion; as alſo to forgive thoſe that are indebted to us. Let them hear this word of Chriſt, who when they are once ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated, do rage with ſuch hardneſs of heart, that they had rather pine themſelves with perpetual Rancor, than be reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their Offenders, whereas in the mean while they ceaſe not to offend God with innumerable ſins, and yet dare to hope for Mercy.

                  <p>CHriſt had ſcarce finiſhed this firſt Word, and loe it took effect, and brought forth fruit preſently: that quick and quickning ſeed was as it were ripe in the ſowers hand before it was ſeen to ſprout up out of the earth, that ground which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this ſeed was but ſtony and barren. For one of the thieves which did hang on the right hand, ſucking in the firſt word of Chriſt with a greedy deſire, changed his barren land into a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full field; for immediately of a Murtherer he became a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:171778:223"/> and was the firſt that of the laſt eſcaped; forſaking all, he followed the Lord, even as he hung upon the Croſs: He brought, and laid down all that he had, his whole poſſeſſion, ſuch as it was, at the feet of crucified Jeſus, he himſelf alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing crucified with him: with his heart he believed unto Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and making confeſſion with his mouth he found ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Wherefore he was accounted more worthy than all the reſt, to whom Chriſt ſpake his ſecond word upon the Croſs: Of which word the Evangeliſts thus write.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And one of the Malefactors which were hanged, railed on him,
<note place="margin">Luke 23.39.</note> ſaying, If thou be Chriſt, ſave thy ſelf and us. But the other anſwering, rebuked him, ſaying, Doſt not thou fear God, ſeeing thou art in the ſame condemnation? And we indeed juſtly, for we receive the due Reward of our deeds, but this man hath done nothing amiſs. And he ſaid unto him, Lord, Remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom. And Jeſus ſaid unto him, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nily, I ſay unto thee, to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we are firſt to take notice, that the Croſs of Chriſt was not only a torment to the condemned, but as it were a Tribunal alſo of the Judge. For it did mercifully receive one of the thieves, and juſtly refuſe the other: juſt as it is now, the Croſs of Chriſt is to ſome a ſtumbling block, but to others it doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their ſalvation, 1
<hi>Cor.</hi> 1. As in the beginning of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we had an example both of Mercy and Judgement, in <hi>Magdalen</hi> and <hi>Judas;</hi> ſo now in the cloſe we have another example in theſe two thieves, whereby it was ſhewed before, that the Paſſion of Chriſt would not be profitable to all; not that it was in it ſelf inſufficient, but becauſe many refuſing Grace when it was offered, do yet ſin with a ſtubborn will.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe Thieves, who blaſphemed Chriſt, it may be out of deſperation and impatience, as ſuch men uſe to do, may be a figure of all wicked wen, who although they ſee Chriſt hang cloſe by them, yet they murmur and blaſpheme under the Croſs; nor are they inſtructed by the example of Chriſt, who took all things patiently. But in vain do they rage and vex themſelves, for they are releaſed never the ſooner; let them blaſpheme never ſo long and never ſo much, they get nothing by it, but they die in their deſperation without any Mercy, as this Thief did. The other Thief is a figure of the godly, who do
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:171778:224"/> both patiently undergo whatever befall them, imputing it to their own ſins, and labour what they can to reduce others to a ſound and ſober mind, who blaſpheme and repine. This thief then hearing, and ſeeing what would be done with Chriſt, and being divinely inſpired, did not queſtion that Chriſt thus ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon another account than he was to ſuffer; for he ſaw Miracles wrought in Heaven and Earth; and he eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that they were not wrought for any goodneſs or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty of the Jews; therefore he began to rebuke and blame his fellow, as one that made no conſcience ſo to blaſpheme Chriſt. And then turning about to Chriſt he doth beg for Grace and Mercy at his hands, which petition of his was not in vain, for he obtained more than he asked. The Lord doth always give more than he is deſired. His prayer was after this manner, <hi>Lord, Remember me when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom; q.d.</hi> The Reaſon why I ſo highly eſteem thee, and run with ſuch boldneſs unto thee, is, becauſe I ſee what tender compaſſion thou haſt of thy Creatures, and with what unheard of patience thou doſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo ſuch great ſufferings. But eſpecially becauſe I now hear thee pray for them that deſpitefully uſe thee, and doſt excuſe their heinous ſin. Theſe are not humane, but ſpiritual and divine things. Remember me therefore. I dare not ask more or greater things at thy hands. I am ſinfull, unworthy of any favour, do but only think on me, let me not be quite forgotten, let me at leaſt with thy dogs eat of the crumbs that fall from the table of thy Grace. I deſire no temporal thing in this life. But when thou comeſt into thy Kingdom, let me be remembred there, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. See here the wonderfull Judgements of God. A Thief makes confeſſion of Chriſt, when all his Diſciples did diſtruſt him. Therefore do not raſhly condemn any, though never ſo wicked. For God can turn him in a moment of time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obſerve here the Ingenuity and Faith of this Thief. He had nothing at command but his heart and tongue: Both theſe he preſenteth to Chriſt, that he might believe in his heart, and confeſs with his mouth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. He did not deſire a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, of which he thought himſelf not worthy, but only that he might not be forgotten, and then he did not care what he did indure, And if you take good heed, you may ſee in this
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:171778:224"/> Thief whatſoever is requiſite in a Chriſtian. He conſeſſed his ſin, he acknowledged Chriſts righteouſneſs, and though he were a Thief, yet did he not deſpair of his ſalvation; no marvel then if he obtained Juſtification and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Here is alſo the fruit of his faith, to wit, Confeſſion and Charity, which he ſhewed to his brother when he reproved him, and would have him acknowledge his ſin, and ſeek ſalvation in Chriſt. Wherefore he was thought worthy to hear that truly comfortable and ſweeteſt word, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto thee, to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> as if he had ſaid:
<note place="margin">The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> My only Companion, although thy great faith doth not crave the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things, yet I am not ignorant what becometh me to give, or what is fit for thee to receive, I will reward that exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and admirable Vertue of thine with the beſt and choiceſt good. For what is more wonderfull, more pure than thy faith? I am forgotten of all men, as a dead man out of mind, <hi>My Neighbours ſtand aloof off, mine acquaintance will not own me,</hi> (Pſalm 31.) My friends are become mine enemies; my Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples forſake and flee from me:
<hi>Peter,</hi> the ſtouteſt of my A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles was daunted at the voyce of one ſilly woman, denyed and forſwore me: <hi>Judas,</hi> whom I truſted with my ſelf, and all that I had, is inticed with a little money, and hath ſold me. The reſt are ſcattered like ſtray ſheep without a Shepherd, deſtitute both of hope and faith. But thou O Thief art come hither out of the lurking places of the thickets and woods, and doſt run to meet me with great affection, more faithfull than my friends, more conſtant then my Diſciples, thou doſt believe, hope, adore, confound the unthankfull, rebuke the blaſphemous, bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to him that is condemned without a cauſe, plead with thy tongue, fighting for me with all the weapons thou haſt. Thou ſeeſt me uſed like a moſt notorious Villain, and yet doſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge me as the moſt holy Redeemer; Thou ſeeſt me as thy Companion in puniſhment, and yet doſt pray to me as to the Lord in Heaven: Thou ſeeſt nothing but the miſery as it were of the vileſt and worſt of men, yet thou confeſſeſt the infinite bleſſedneſs of my Kingdom in another world. <hi>Surely fleſh and blood hath not revealed theſe things unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 16. <hi>Truly thy faith is great, greater I have not found in Iſrael,</hi> Mat. 8. <hi>Abraham believed me, but

But thou believeſt now I am hanging on the moſt ſhamefull Croſs, and can hardly fetch breath, as well as if I were working ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Miracle. I never met with ſuch a faith before.
<hi>Nicodemus</hi> and <hi>Nathaniel</hi> believed, being inſtructed out of the Scriptures.

The Diſciples believed, becauſe they were incouraged by being promiſed to ſit upon twelve Thrones, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. Thou never ſaweſt any of all theſe things. Thou haſt not read the Scriptures, thou haſt ſeen no ſigns, thou haſt heard none of the Promiſes, and yet thou believeſt, nay, thou doſt make glory appear out of infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and innocency out of condemnation. Have but a little patience, thou ſhalt not ſtay long without a reward of ſo great a faith. For although thou art now hard by the gates of death, and the Ax is cutting down the tree of thy life, yet thou art come in good time, and ſeaſonably enough. There is place yet for pardon, the gate of Mercy is not yet ſhut, nay the fountain of Grace and Favour doth now flow more abundantly than it was wont to do. Go to, Be it unto thee according to thy Faith. Faith ſtopt the womans iſſue of blood; it ſhall cleanſe thee from the contagion of all thy ſins. Faith freed the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiſh</hi> daughter that was vexed with Devils; it ſhall quit thee of the ſerpent that lurketh at thy heel, deliver thee from the ſnare of the Hunter, and from the expectation of thine enemies whom thou haſt ſerved. By faith the Lepers were cleanſed, the blind made to ſee, the ſick of the Palſie reſtored to health; thou by this thy faith ſhalt obtain eternal Glory, and the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thy ſoul. By this thy faith thou ſhalt not (with
<hi>Enoch</hi>) ſee the bitterneſs of death; thou ſhalt he ſaved from the flood with <hi>Neah,</hi> thou ſhalt with <hi>Abraham</hi> receive a place which thou knoweſt not, for an Inheritance; thou ſhalt not with
<hi>Moſes,</hi> be ſmitten with the deſtroying Angel, and ſhalt paſs ſafely through the ſea. Thou like another <hi>Caleb</hi> ſhalt enter into a land flowing with Milk and Hony. I Jeſus will conduct thee thither. It ſhall be better and more honourable for thee, that thou haſt hung by my ſide, than if thou hadſt ſate before <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar</hi>
                     <pb n="365" facs="tcp:171778:225"/> in golden Hangings, and in his Ivory Chair. Thou ſhalt have much more Honour and Renown than <hi>Auguſtus</hi> himſelf. It ſhall be more ſweet and pleaſant to thee to partake with me in my torments, than if thou hadſt been Monarch and ſole King of all the earth.

This day ſhalt thou take the Land of the living, which thou haſt trampled upon with thy feet, for thine eternal poſſeſſion, becauſe thou haſt followed the Lord thy God. This petition of thine ſeems but a light Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to thoſe that are without, for what is more eaſie than to remember?

Then ſaith he to his Diſciple, behold thy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And from that hour that Diſciple took her unto his own home.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The women follow Chriſt even to the Croſs, and ſtay with him even to the very death. Mean while the Apoſtles ſhift for themſelves, and get them out of ſight. Thus <hi>God chuſeth the weak things of the world to confound the mighty,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Among all the Women that followed Chriſt, the firſt that is named is the Virgin-mother, to whom Chriſt ſpake the third Word. He had firſt prayed for them that crucified him, and firſt comforted the Thief: not that he did not ſee his Mother ſtanding by, or did not know what great trouble and ſorrow ſhe was in, but that he might not ſeem to reſpect perſons or particular affections. It was for the ſake of ſinners that he came into the world, and they had moſt need of him: therefore he doth firſt ſpeak to the Thief. But now the third time he turneth him to his Mother, that he might not ſeem to neglect her.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Iohn</hi> doth moſt ſweetly deſcribe and ſet down this third Word, with all the circumſtances thereof: and doth uſe ſuch words as have truly a very hidden Vertue in them, and are ſo powerfull to reſolve and melt the tears of Believers into an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſweetneſs, that if the moſt obdurate and hard-hearted man in the world ſhould with dry heart and eyes paſs by the reading of this ſtupendious and amazing Paſſion of Jeſus, yet when he cometh to theſe words, in which are recited the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that bleſſed Virgin by the croſs of her Son, the tender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and expreſſions of a dying Son to his Mother; his ſilial recommendation, and the ſeparation, parting or taking leave of that moſt Holy Mother, and that ſo loving and dutifull Son one of another, he would not be able to refrain weeping. For every word here expreſt will encreaſe and heighten his Devotion. What need elſe had there been to have ſo exactly ſet down and
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:171778:227"/> deſcribed both how and where the Virgin. Mother ſtood. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The preſence of friends is wont to be a refreſhing to the afflicted, when they are deſtitute and deprived of ſome other comforts, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Two are better then one, becauſe they have a good reward for thair labour. For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow,</hi> Eccl. 4. But this preſence of friends here had no ſuch advantage. It was a moſt ſad ſight both to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſtood by, and to the Son that was hanging on the Croſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What a ſtrange and new thing is here reported, that the Mother of Jeſus ſtood by the Croſs? For what haſt thou, O Holy Virgin, what haſt thou to do with the Croſs? What fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip hath a loathſome and deſpicable place with the Temple of God? What agreement is there between a curſed place of butchery, and a bleſſed Armory of Heavenly Ammunition? what accord is there between the puniſhment of Malefactors, &amp; the Mirrour of Virgin-purity? But ſhe did not ſtand ſimply by the croſs, but by the Croſs of Jeſus, who was both her Father and Son at one and the ſame time; her Bridegroom and Lord, her child and her God; and becauſe he had all theſe (Relations) in him, and was all theſe to her, therefore ſhe could not forſake him. She followed her beloved Son all alone, at leaſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a very few, although the Diſciples were fled, and the enemies enraged. She doth follow, I ſay, and ſee what is done, when he could neither help, nor comfort her any way, but with tears and tender compaſſion. When ſhe had loſt him before but for three dayes, ſhe went up and down about the Villages near <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſorrowfully ſeeking him amongſt her Kinsfolk and Acquaintance, till ſhe had found him, as it is, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. But now ſhe could no longer look for him among his Acquaintance, for they all ſtood afar off from him. Therefore ſhe took this motherly counſell with her ſelf, and reſolved in her heart thus: Here will I ſtand and ſtay to ſee the Sentence of death executed upon my dear child. I will follow him cloſe at his heels as he goeth out of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I will obſerve and look with weeping eyes whither they lead him. I will ſee how they ſpoyl him, I will ſeriouſly mark how they pierce his hands and feet, how they faſten him to the gallows, how they will toſs and mount him up, how they will ſling and ſwinge up the croſs.

I will tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry till he depart, I will ſee how he goeth out of the world, for I only know how he came into this world. I will not leave him dying, whom I could never forſake living. Thou didſt very well, O Holy Mother to ſtand by him, when every body elſe had forſaken him. For ſo did he firſt vouchſafe to come to thee, paſſing by all other creatures. This is that invincible Unicorn which none could ever take or over-rule, who was long ſince earneſtly importuned, and as it were rouzed up by the ſervent prayers and deſires of the Holy Fathers, and not able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf any longer, was at laſt taken in thy Virgin-lap. And lo, now thou doſt (according to thy power) requite that his ſo great favour to thee. He left all and beſtowed himſelf upon thee: and now all forſake him; thou like a dear Mother doſt ſtand it out with him: thy ſtanding by him at the Croſs, is but ſad company to him, whilſt thou doſt there inviſibly ſuffer in thy heart, whatſoever he did viſibly endure in his body: When the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> would deſcribe this ineffable and ſad ſuffering, he doth not call her by her proper Name, but diſcovers her by a Name of pity and Piety, <hi>Mother, his Mother.</hi> Nor could he more fully expreſs or deſcribe her grief, then by ſaying thus: <hi>His Mother ſtood by the Croſs of Jeſus.</hi> Here ſhe had full tryall of what
<hi>Simeon</hi> told her before, <hi>Luke</hi> 2. <hi>A Sword ſhall pierce through thine own ſoul:</hi> the pains ſhe eſcaped in child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, ſhe now meets with at the croſs. To other Women it is ſaid, <hi>In ſorrow ſhalt thou bring forth children,</hi> Gen. 3. But <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> felt not the pains of travel; yet was ſhe not therefore free from all pain: Now if the Virgin mother was not without her croſs, who amongſt us ſhall think to eſcape it? Chriſt doth ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and his Mother doth ſuffer with him: and doſt thou think of nothing but merriments? The Virgin <hi>ſtood,</hi> and yet they were not come to the place, but ſhe followed him as he went out with his croſs: and yet ſhe <hi>ſtood,</hi> not afar off, but hard by the

<pb n="371" facs="tcp:171778:229"/> croſs: whereby ſhe ſhewed the conſtancy of a Mother, and the valour of her mind. Conſider, O man, conſider what great grief this was to her. None ever received greater Favour; and never any endured greater pain and ſorrow then the Virgin-Mother. His Mother <hi>ſtood</hi> full of courage, full of affection, and full of devotion. Shee <hi>ſtood,</hi> rouling that unutterable flame of Love in her Boſom, wherewith her Son was ſet on fire. And ſhe alſo was enflamed with a vehement heat of Love, examining her ſelf, if it were ſhe that had brought forth ſuch a Son, who could ſo willingly pardon and paſs by ſuch affronts, yea and excuſe them alſo who dealt ſo cruelly with him. She <hi>ſtood,</hi> conſidering and pondering the hard and moſt bitter extremities of her Son, with which ſhe, by reaſon of her Motherly affection, was moſt grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly Tortured: but withall ſhe did, according to her wiſdom and burning charity, conſider the benefit that would thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to Mankind, and the glory of God that would ariſe from it. She
<hi>ſtood</hi> with the reſt of the Women and Friends at the croſs full of ſorrow and miſery, ſlighting all the gibes and jeers that ſhe had caſt on her for her Sons-ſake Chriſt Jeſus. But her Motherly Love conquered and overcame all theſe diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>But although Chriſt was in infinite ſtreights, yet he doth not neglect his Mother in that hour. And when he had no member free, but his Eyes and Tongue, he doth not diſdain to ſerve his Mother with them both. He directs them both to her, looking upon her, and ſpeaking to her, to ſhew how highly he did eſteem her in his heart, and to teach us practically and really that our Parents are to be honoured by us, and that we ſhould take care of them even to the death. At other times Chriſt ſeems to ſpeak more harſhly to his Mother: to wit, when he was about Gods buſineſs, as
<hi>Matth.</hi> 12. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. <hi>John</hi> 2. For all humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and reſpect muſt ceaſe and give place to Gods buſineſs. But here on the Croſs he doth faithfully and humanely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his Mother: for what ſhe had brought forth did now hang before her eyes. <hi>When Jeſus,</hi> ſaith he; <hi>ſaw his Mother.</hi> O the aſtoniſhing Miracle of Viſion indeed! O the lamentable glances which might have been ſeen in the eyes of Jeſus! Thoſe eyes at one and the ſame time did haſten towards death, and turn aſide to his Mother. The power of death did cloſe and weaken them,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:171778:230"/> and the force of love did open them again to behold his Mother. O how deeply was the Ray of that laſt look faſtened in thy heart! O thou Holy Mother, which the Lord of the world was pleaſed to glance upon thee when he was about to dye! It was a Dart indeed, which did not only wound thy heart, but it was alſo a Sword that pierced the very inward parts of thy ſoul. O how full of ſobbs and ſighs waſt thou! with what floods of grief waſt thou overwhelmed when thou doſt caſt thy weeping eyes upward at once to ſee thy Son dying, and at the ſame time wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looking upon thee?</p>
                  <p>Nor doth Chriſt ſerve his Mother with his eyes only, beholding her therewith: but he doth alſo comfort her with his Tongue.

                  <p n="1">1. That he might not encreaſe her ſorrow. It was not a time now to complement, or uſe ſmooth words and ſugared expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to her, nor to call her Mother.

                  <p n="2">2. He doth call her <hi>Woman,</hi> for if he had called Mother, it might have given occaſion to them that crucified him to uſe her more hardly.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although ſhe is above meaſure to be extoli'd as a Virgin, yet ſhe is much more highly to be commended by the Name of Woman: inaſmuch as God was pleaſed to honour her Bowels with this ſacred iſſue; and by her to expound to the world that Covenant which God heretofore made to <hi>Abraham.</hi> Hence it is that Chriſt here from the croſs doth call her <hi>Woman.</hi> Hence it is that the Angell pronounced her bleſſed among <hi>Women</hi> Hence it is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,
<hi>Chriſt was made of a Woman,</hi> Gal. 4.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of the word is,
<note place="margin">The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> as if Chriſt had ſaid, Woman, I know the perplexing cares of thy breaſt, I know thy ſorrow, I know thy pitifull compaſſion, thy Religion and thy Charity.

Thou wouldſt fain anoint me with the Ointment of Piety; Thou thinkeſt to comfort the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate with thy preſence, thou couldeſt wiſh to die with me, yea to die alone, and excuſe me by thy death. All this I accept, and take it in good part: but it doth as much wound as mitigate. For
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:171778:230"/> thy ſoul will not be ſolaced except thou haſt me reſtored to thee again ſafe an ſound: O therwiſe all Plaiſters, Medicines, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, are to no purpoſe: whatſoever is offered to thee, is but all in vain. But thou haſt long ſince been confirmed with ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Vertue, anointed throughly with ſo much oyl of Grace and Favour, compleatly accompliſhed with ſuch perfections, that thou art black without filthineſs, mourning without naſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, decently behaving thy ſelf with all comlineſs in this thy bitter condition: thou art troubled, yet chearfull; mournfull, yet merry, free from faultineſs; ſobbing, yet ſinging, not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly dejected: thou art defective in nothing, for thou canſt ſmile when thou weepeſt, abide moſt conſtant when thou art thruſt thorow with ſo many Swords, and preſerve thy Life when thou art dying. Wherefore thou moſt valliant woman, in due time thou ſhalt receive a full Recompence and Reward; nor ſhalt thou be deſtitute of all comfort for the preſent, if a moſt miſerable and afflicted man can give any ſolace and ſuccour to an afflicted woman. Seeſt thou in what Torments I hang here? With what difficulties I ſtruggle? with what vexations and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities my ſtrength is worn and waſted? At what price, at what rate may I purchaſe but one ſinner? With what charity ſhall I embrace mankind? I have appeaſed my Fathers wrath; it remaineth now that I forſake thee not. Moſt dear Parent, hitherto indeed thou haſt ſhewed thy ſelf a moſt tender and carefull Mother to me from the time I was born, to this very laſt hour; and haſt diſcharged all Motherly affection and reſpect to me: and now I am ready to dye, thou art perhaps afraid that none will own thee, but that thou ſhalt be left to the wide world. But be not caſt down with ſuch thoughts: lo here is that <hi>John,</hi> thy near Kinſman ſtanding by, very dear to thee, and alſo to me: thou mayeſt expect and promiſe to thy ſelf all aſſiſtance from him.

Again, let no man thruſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the ſervice of <hi>Mary:</hi> that is, of the Church, unleſs God hath committed the charge thereof to him. He called his ſervants and gave them money to trade with, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. No man ought to take this Honour to himſelf, but he that is called of God, as <hi>Aaron</hi> was,
<hi>Heb.</hi> 5. Let the Miniſter of the Church take heed and ſee that he be a <hi>John:</hi> that is, that he expreſs the Grace of God, not only in Word and Name, but in deed and in Truth alſo. Beſide, in this Recommendation of Chriſts Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto <hi>John;</hi> Chriſt alluded to that Spiritual acquaintance and kindred which ought to be among Believers in the Church. Nay, he doth here inſtitute and ordain this Kindred, whereby every one ſhould be a Father, Mother, Brother, and Siſter to another, as
<hi>Paul</hi> writeth to <hi>Timothy,</hi> that he ſhould reſpect the Elder men as Fathers, and the Elder Women as Mothers, the yonger as Siſters
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. And as <hi>John,</hi> after this recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſt, could ſay that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was his Mother; ſo may we call her Mother, inaſmuch as ſhe brought forth Chriſt

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:171778:232"/> our Brother. And as <hi>John</hi> might call <hi>Peter</hi> Brother: ſo alſo may we. This is our Chriſtian brotherhood and Spiritual Kindred, which is our great conſolation. For hence we ſee, that the Saints belong to us, and we to them. They acknowledge and love us; let us alſo acknowledge and love them. In concluſion it is ſaid, that <hi>John</hi> like a faithfull &amp; obedient Diſciple, and as one mindfull of his Maſters command, did take <hi>Mary</hi> from that very day for his own mother unto his own home: Not that he had a ſetled place, or any thing of his own, (for the Apoſtles left all they had, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. and what they had was common to all, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.) But that he took her into his own care, and miniſtred unto her for time to come as a ſon to his mother: He took her, not to his Farm or Manour-Houſe, for he had none: but to his charge, which he took care to diſcharge by his own miniſtring to her: ſo ſaith <hi>Auguſtine.</hi>

                  <p>THree Words we have heard already, which Chriſt uttered on the Croſs: the firſt to his Father, the ſecond to the Thief, the third to his Mother; and they were all very ſweet and comfortable Words indeed. The hour of death now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, he expreſſeth the fourth Word, and that with great gravity: he ſpeaks again to his Father, but very moaningly and pittifully, of which the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> thus write:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And when the ſixth hour was come,
<note place="margin">Mar. 15.33.</note> there was darkneſs over the whole land untill the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jeſus cryed with a loud voyce, ſaying, Eli, Eli, Lamaſabachtani: which is being interpreted, my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? And ſome of them that ſtood by, when they heard it, ſaid, Behold, he calleth</hi> Elias.</p>
                  <p>There were now ſix hours of the day paſt, and yet thoſe wicked men were not ſatisfied with what Chriſt had then ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Wherefore to reprove their ungodlineſs, the Sun is dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened; that viſible Sun is much afflicted and obſcured, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the injury done to the true Son of Righteouſneſs; and that contrary to the cuſtom and courſe of Heaven, foraſmuch as about this time there was no Ecclipſe of the Sun, as <hi>Theophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact</hi>
                     <pb n="377" facs="tcp:171778:232"/> out of <hi>Jerom</hi> ſaith.

Away with all ſuch compariſons, even of the greateſt Monarchs. This is truly a ſign that doth deſerve to be written and read, to be ſaid and ſung as long as the world laſteth. This unuſual darkneſs,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Did prove Chriſts Divinity, to whom all the Elements do homage, and are ready to ſerve him at his pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſhewed his Innocency: for the Elements are diſturbed at his death, to make it known that Chriſt ſuffered innocent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; the Creatures give teſtimony to their Creator.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The heavenly Father would make it appear by theſe ſigns, that he took notice of the great evils and unworthy behaviour of men, which yet he was pleaſed to turn to the ſalvation of them that ſhould believe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

                  <p>Now when this Darkneſs had continued for about three hours, Chriſt began to to ſpeak again, yea, to cry out with a loud voyce, to prove the Truth of his Humanity, and to ſhew the intenſneſs and extremity of his pain, againſt ſuch Hereſies as ſhould after ariſe, either denying the Lord to be a true man, or that he did not truly ſuffer, but only made a flouriſhing ſhew of ſuffering.

                     <pb n="378" facs="tcp:171778:234"/> his true and grievous ſorrow and pain: for although they were intolerable things which the Standers by did ſee; yet Chriſt endured much more than what the outward eyes ſaw: And to make it known, he cryed out, to fulfill that of <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69. <hi>I am weary of crying, my throat is dryed,</hi> &amp;c. And well might he be hoarſe, for hoarſneſs proceedeth from a defect of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours in the throat and Arteries. But his ſtrength was dryed up like a Pot-ſheard, the humours of blood guſhing out in all parts of his body.</p>
                  <p>But let us hear how, and with what voyce he cryed out. He ſaith, <hi>Eli, Eli, Lama azabthani.</hi> This word is taken out of
<hi>Pſalm</hi> 22. which <hi>Pſalm</hi> in the Hebrew doth begin with thoſe very words. Chriſt therefore makes uſe of the beginning of that
<hi>Pſalm,</hi> to ſhew that the whole <hi>Pſalm</hi> was made to him, and of him. Where me may obſerve that Chriſt doth not complain of ſuffering, but of Deſertion; and not of every kind of Deſertion neither. For they to whom he had done much good, yea, and his own Diſciples too, had deſerted and left him in the midſt of his enemies and perſecutors. And yet he doth not ſo much as think upon this Deſertion, but he doth cry out eſpecially, and complain that the Father had forſaken him; which we muſt not ſo underſtand, as if the Divinity had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated it ſelf from the humanity of Chriſt, but that it left that Humanity for a time to the power of his Perſecutors, and did not defend it with his Power; and did moreover for a while, withdraw from it all Conſolation and ſupernatural Aſſiſtance. God did always ſuccour the reſt of the Martyrs with his ſpecial comforts, either by hindering the act of outward torments, as in the three Children,
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon whom the flames of fire could not faſten,</hi> Dan. 3. Or elſe by ſending into them the inward ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Spirit, ſo that they did not at all feel any pain of the body, or elſe might endure them more eaſily and joyfully. But Chriſt had no ſenſible comfort at all from above in his whole Paſſion, ſo that he might truly ſay, Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſs the way? <hi>Behold and ſee, if there be any ſorrow like unto my ſorrow,</hi> Lam. 1.12. For who did ever undergo ſuch ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious and grievous torments? It is God that ſuffereth. Nor doth he lighten the weight and preſs of his Paſſion one jot, who was wont, either altogether to free his ſervants, or elſe to eaſe or
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:171778:234"/> ſhorten the force of their torments. He that uſeth to ſpare ſinners, doth take no pitty upon himſelf. Well therefore might <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, <hi>He ſpared not his

There is no whole part in my body from the ſole of my foot to the crown of my head. And there is no ſoundneſs in my ſoul from the loweſt feet of ſenſe, to the top of the head of reaſon.

My fleſh is ſorely afflicted, becauſe it is more tender, quick and ſenſible. My ſoul is ſick of greater trouble, becauſe it is more innocent, wiſe and excellent than others. My fleſh is in pain, my ſoul is full of grief: And what part is free, being deprived of thy aid? Tribulation and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh have ſeiſed on me, and every moment my griefs increaſe. What great ſorrow doth the offence that is taken at thy name ſtir up in me? How doth the trouble of my mother, the fear and cowardiſe of my Diſciples, the ſcandall of weak ones, the errour of them that crucifie me, how do theſe things afflict me? And how alſo do the ſtreights of all the Saints which have been, are, or ſhall be, which they undergo for my Names-ſake, trouble me? How greatly alſo doth the wickedneſs of their ingratitude who will ſin to Eternity afflict me? How do they rip up the ſcars of my wounds afreſh, pierce and prick my whole heart, rent and tear, waſte and deſtroy all that is capable to be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſturb'd in me? But a moſt clear Argument of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable grief is, that if every particular ſin of all mankind
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:171778:235"/> were brought into one heap, a huge heap alas it is: yet it is thy pleaſure that my blood ſhould ſuffice for the expiating of them all, and therefore haſt thou imbittered me with ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and haſt laid ſuch a load on my ſhoulders. <hi>I have trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the Wine-preſs alone, and of the peaple there was none with me,</hi> Iſa. 63.

I am in great pain, but the greatneſs of my love doth far exceed it. Yea though thou ſhouldeſt yet forſake me more, and though they ſhould be yet more ungratefull, yet I cannot be ſeparated from the love of thee and them whom thou haſt called. For who ſhall ſeparate me from thy Love? Shall tribulation, or diſtreſs? But thou haſt forſaken me, that
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:171778:236"/> thou mayeſt not forſake me; thou haſt humbled me, that thou mayeſt make me great: thou haſt caſt me off, that thou mayeſt receive me moſt honourably. Thou haſt forſaken me, and haſt left me only this, that I may (though without comfort) flee unto, and call upon thee. Wherefore let thy chaſtened Son be pleaſing to thee, and willingly hear him, who doth in his great exerciſe of affliction ſend up his roaring cry of charity unto thee. <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Now concerning this place we may obſerve firſt, that this cry, <hi>(Why haſt thou forſaken me?)</hi> was not fictitious or feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but moſt real and true: and not only of the mouth, but alſo of the heart, and all the humane force and powers: For Chriſt at this hour had ſtript himſelf of God, not by caſting him away, but by not perceiving and feeling him, acting the part of a pure man. It was truly and overmuch an Humane voyce, proceeding from Humane affection; ſo to complain, why God ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him, and why he ſhould ſuffer wicked men to do ſo much. So
<hi>David, I was envious at the fooliſh, when I ſaw the proſperity of the wicked,</hi> Pſalm 73. And <hi>Jeremiah: Why doth the way of the wicked proſper?</hi> Jer. 12. And <hi>Habbakuk: Why doſt thou ſhew me iniquity, and cauſe me to behold grievance? for ſpoiling and violence are before me. How long ſhall I cry, and thou wilt not hear?</hi> Hab. 1. <hi>Wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly, and holeſt thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous then he?</hi> Hab.
1.13. Thus Chriſt ſpeaks here out of Humane affection. And ſo he did ſufficiently ſhew his true Humanity when he prayed before in the Garden. But this miſerable cry doth much more clearly ſhew the ſame againſt ſuch Hereticks as ſhould after ſpring up, denying his Humane nature. Let none therefore be offended at this complaint which was truly Humane: but let every one think with himſelf that fleſh and blood did here truly hang on the croſs, <hi>in the form of a ſervant,</hi> Phil. 2. Theſe things are tryed and proved on the croſs by death, and the pure Humanity. But after three dayes you ſhall ſee and find much other things, when the new, and living, and chearfull Body ſhall riſe out of the Sepulchre. So then it is plain, that Chriſt as he was girt with greateſt gladneſs, ſo he was alſo compoſſed with extream ſorrow. And as he was endowed with the higheſt Truth, ſo he was beſet with the deepeſt and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:171778:236"/> infirmity: and as he ſpent his life in the greateſt peace, ſo he lived alſo in ſoreſt troubles. I ſay, as Chriſt enjoyed the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, ſo he taſted the bitterneſs of death.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Obſerve, that that Deſertion of Chriſt, is the fear and dread of our conſcience for ſin which we commit, which doth find and feel the Judgement of God and eternal Wrath, and is ſo affected therewith, as if it were perpetually forſaken and caſt out from the preſence of God for ever, according to that of <hi>David: I ſaid in my haſte, I am cut off from before thine eyes,</hi> Pſalm 31.22. Who can but deſpair when Judgement is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? There is none can ſtand before the Judgement of God, or is able to bear it. For as the too great Splendor of the Sun will dazle and darken the eyes, and loud noyſe make one deaf: ſo the Judgement of God is too loud for our mind and heart to endure: and too heavy for our humane ſtrength to undergo. And therefore it forceth a man to deſpair, becauſe there is no way open to eſcape, as <hi>Amos</hi> ſaith: <hi>They ſhall not eſcape: he that fleeth of them, ſhall not flee away. Though they dig into Hell, thence ſhall my hand take them,</hi> Amos 9. When the Lord comes thus to Judgement, all the creatures obey him, and further the Judgement of God, to execute all fearfull plagues upon the damned, as it is in <hi>Joel: The Earth ſhall quake, the Heavens ſhall tremble, the Suu and the Moon ſhall be dark,</hi> Joel 2. Again, <hi>In that day the Sun ſhall go down at noon,</hi> Amos 8. That is, in the day of the Lords Judgement. What is more miſerable then man ſo judged of the Lord, deſtitute of the counſel, comfort, and help of all the creatures, and deſpairing? This is the Judgement that all we deſerved for our ſins. Chriſt therefore the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son of God did of his meer Mercy, without any of our merit, caſt himſelf into our caſe, and took that puniſhment which we had deſerved upon his own ſhoulders. Here we ſee on one hand the common people ſtand reviling Chriſt, the Prieſts blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheming, the Thieves curſing, the Apoſtles denying him, his Friends forſaking him, the Earth moved, the Sun darkened: in ſhort, all horrid things, and all the creatures ſet againſt him. On the other hand we ſee God alſo his Adverſary, and ſo forſaking him, that he cryes out, why haſt thou forſaken me? Which of us would not have deſpaired in ſuch neceſſity? But Chriſt took all this upon him, that he might overcome our deſperation, and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:171778:237"/> give us alſo hope in the like extremity. So that this was our voyce or cry, who by no means were able to bear the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, but muſt have deſpaired. But Chriſt took that Cry upon himſelf, and overcame our deſpair, that now we may be ſure God will never forſake us, no though he ſeem ſo to do; as Chriſt in that hour ſeemed to be forſaken of God, in that he could perceive no conſolation from him, whereas he was not indeed forſaken of him, but was even then the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Son of God. So that here we are well aſſured, that God is never more preſent; then when he ſeemeth to be fartheſt of. <hi>In a ſmall moment,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for a little while have I forſaken thee, but with great mercies will I gather thee,</hi> Iſa. 54. Chriſt therefore that he might deliver ſinners, put himſelf in the ſtead of all ſinners, yet was he no Thief, Adulterer, Murderer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but he undertook the wages, puniſhment, and deſert of ſinners (which are cold, heat, hunger, thirſt, fear, trembling horrour of death and Hell, Deſperation, Death, Hell it ſelf,) that he might conquer hunger with hunger, fear with fear, horrour with horrour, deſperation with deſperation, death with death, hell with hell; in brief, that he might conquer Satan by Satan. It is the gallanteſt kind of Victory to kill the enemy with his own Sword. Hence ſaith <hi>Paul: Godſent his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinfull fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin,</hi> Rom. 8. So <hi>Iſaiah: Thou haſt broken the Rod of the oppreſſor, as in the day of</hi> Midian, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. For the
<hi>Midianites</hi> ſlew one another, <hi>Judg.</hi> 7. Thus Satan was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by his own arms, as <hi>David</hi> ſlew <hi>Goliah</hi> with his own Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We are here taught how to behave our ſelves in Tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Afflictions: even to run to God in them all with a believing mind, that he would be pleaſed to look on our Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here alſo we learn, that we ſhould freely follow Chriſt in the ſame way by which he entered into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and not grumble at our preſſures, foraſmuch as the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is not above his Maſter, nor the ſervant above his Lord. But then ſhall we be truly bleſſed, when we partake of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt, ſuffer adverſity for his Names ſake; when nothing is ſweet unto us but Jeſus, nothing harſh but to be parted from Jeſus: and what wiſe man would not rather go
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:171778:237"/> with the King in a mourning Habit, and with his Nobles clad in blacks into a moſt ſtately Palace of pleaſure and joy, then to be trimmed up in gay cloaths, and with the raſcall ſort to be ſhut out of doors? The Veſtment of Chriſt is dyed purple with blood: and ſo are the garments of the Martyrs, for they preſſed into the celeſtial Joy thorow many Tribulations and the moſt ſtrict Life; We ſee how little cauſe we have to complain of croſſes and afflictions, eſpecially if we conſider that we juſtly ſuffer for our ſins.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Laſtly, We are by this Word inſtructed how to quench the burning heat of luſt. To the beating down of which evil there is not a more wholſome and effectual Herb to be had, then to conſider that the Lord Jeſus was thus forſaken of all, yea of his very Father, expoſed to ſo many Torments, void of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Refreſhments, and that he being guiltleſs ſhould yet endure all manner of Tortures and Adverſities for other mens faults. But O ye Fornicators and Adulterers, how do you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite your moſt miſerably afflicted Chriſt? If ye cannot endure to be deprived of ſome momentany and petty pleaſures, nor taſte a little of ſome bitter or ſharp potion for your health and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal welfare, how will ye be able to hazard blood, body, and life too for Chriſt and the brethren? Where do ye faſten your affections? Why do ye ſtick ſo faſt to the earth, whoſe birth and blood is higher then the Heavens? O ye that dwell in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards of <hi>Engedi,</hi> why periſh ye like the dung in <hi>Endor?</hi> Ye Citizens of Paradiſe, why wallow you in the ſtyes of
<hi>Aſphaltites,</hi> why tumble ye in the mire and mud of the dead Sea? Take a bundle of this Myrrhe, meditate upon the Paſſion of the Lord, that ye may be healed of that loathſome luſt. And ſo much for this Word.</p>
                  <p>It is added in the cloſe, that Chriſt even in this his dolefull and miſerable cry did not want ſuch as mocked him,
<hi>Behold,</hi> ſay they, <hi>this man calleth for</hi> Elias.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Jerome</hi> is of opinion that theſe were the
<hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers, who underſtood not the propriety of the
<hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But others think they were <hi>Hebrews,</hi> who did openly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave and wreſt the words of Chriſt againſt their conſcience, as if he now implored the help of <hi>Elias,</hi> who before had ſaid he was the Son of God: If they had not been ſtark blind, they
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:171778:238"/> might have ſeen, that by this great cry he applyed to himſelf that place of Scripture where all things were foretold which they then ſaw to be fulfilled before their eyes, and for the moſt part were already fulfilled.</p>

                  <p>MEn that are deſolate and forſaken uſe to ſeek eaſe and ayd which way ſoever they turn themſelves. So Chriſt at the entrance into his Paſſion foreſeeing and conſidering thoſe things which he was to ſuffer, fell into an agony &amp; the anguiſh of death: ſometime running to God by prayer, then again returning to his Diſciples, ſeeking comfort from both. So now here alſo when he found himſelf forſaken of God, he doth ſeek for ſome ſmall refreſhment even from men, eſpecially by a little drink; for of the two the want of drink is more tedious then that of meat to thoſe that are weary and tyred out, who ſometimes are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſreſhed with a few drops, Therefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus knowing that all things were now accompliſhed,
<note place="margin">John 19 28.</note> that the Scripture might be fulfilled, ſaith, I thirſt. Now there was ſet a Veſſel full of Vineger, and they filled a ſpunge with vineger, and put it upon Hyſop, and put it to his mouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is laſt of all tormented in his Taſte, as
<hi>Eve</hi> in the laſt place ſinned in her taſting, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. For before ſhe had taſted the forbidden fruit, ſhe had ſinned by luſting after it, and reaching out her hand to take it. Now this thirſt of Chriſt was partly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, and partly Myſtical. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt he was exceeding weary, and had ſweat abundantly: beſides he hung naked on the croſs expoſed to Sun and Wind: So that queſtionleſs he muſt needs be grievouſly athirſt: which doth eaſily appear in that he doth ſo pittifully expreſs the ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his thirſt by a mournfull intreaty, as if he had forgot all his other pains; although he did not do or ſay this ſo much to quench his thirſt, as to fulfill the Scripture. <hi>That the Scripture might be fulfilled,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I thirſt.</hi> But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He did ſpiritually thirſt after our Salvation, his deſire was to overcome the Devil, and to ſet man at liberty, though he died for't. And this thirſt he was never without: but
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:171778:238"/> now in his Paſſion he did diſcover it more then before; for here it doth truly appear how earneſtly he thirſted for our Salvation, however all his works alſo everywhere do witneſs this very thing.</p>
                  <p>The meaning then of the word is, as if he had ſaid,
<note place="margin">The ſenſe.</note> Dear Brethren, whereas I am yours, and do extreamly thirſt after your ſalvation as one that doth entirely love you, and am now for the love-ſake of you and your Salvation caſt off and forſaken of God, the fervency of my love doth command and compell me to ſearch exactly and trace out, if happily there be any place of pity and mercy to be found in your breaſts, who are obliged to me by large favours, and whom I have purchaſed at ſo dear a rate. Charity, I ſay, and even neceſſity it ſelf, do force me to beg of you and put you upon the tryal, to ſee what thanks you will render to me for the great ſorrow and pains I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and gone thorow for your ſakes. I do not call to you to come into the ſame miſery with me, I do not deſire that you ſhould hazard any of your blood or life: I neither covet nor ſeek any of your Gold, Silver, or any precious thing that ye have got or purchaſed with great pains and induſtry: Nay it is a very ſmall matter and eaſie to be had: that which I entreat now in my neceſſity at this very pinch of death, is no more but what Nature hath made common to all men: I thirſt, I cannot hide it, and now I have it known, I humbly entreat a little drink at your hands.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I thirſt, I deſire but a little cold water: what leſs can be deſired? and what can more unworthily be denyed? I am ſore athirſt, I ask but ſo much water of you as I have ſhed either ſweat or blood for your Salvation: Nay not ſo much, I ask but a very little of you. I thirſt, I have not ſlept one wink all this night, but have ſpent it in Toyling, Tortures, Travel, Stripes, and Wounds; my blood, vital humour, and all my ſtrength is quite ſpent and waſted. My heart is like melting wax in the midſt of my belly, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22. My ſtrength is dryed up like a pot-ſheard, my tongue cleaveth to my jawes, my bones are as dry as a ſtick. I have ſtretched out my hands all the day, my ſoul is as the earth without water, as the parched ground; I thirſt. I pray not for the lengthening of my life: I pray not againſt death, the croſs, or any other kind of torment: do but only
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:171778:239"/> quench my thirſt, this is all I beg of you. Is there none among ſo many, that will take pity on my ſoul and refreſh it? The wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not to be fetch'd with ſuch hazard out of the Camp of the <hi>Philiſtins,</hi> 2 Sam. 23. Nor is there ſuch a great gulf fixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween you and me, <hi>Luke</hi> 16. The diſtance is not ſo great, but that ye may eaſily help me in this condition.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I thirſt, not only in body, but rather, and more eſpecially in my ſoul: I deſire thy Salvation, O man, more then water, and thy Redemption more then my own refreſhment. It is for thee, I ſay, that I thirſt, nor do I deſire only to taſte of thee, but to ſuck and ſwallow thee up wholly into my bowels by a full draught of Love. To quench this thirſt it is that I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken ſuch a journey, ſet upon ſo much hardſhip, ſuffered ſo many Tortures: and that nothing may be wanting for thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, I do yet thirſt after a thouſand more ſuch Torments. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold now is the time that my ſtrength ſhould fail: therefore that I may not be diſappointed of my deſired wiſhes, do not, O man, do not this day harden thy heart: but take the fire of Holy Love, which may ſo boyl thee by its heat, that thou mayeſt breath forth chaſt groans, and pour our abundance of tears, and with theſe let me be fed. I crave not many things at thy hands, yea I will abundantly recompence ſmall matters: I will not deſpiſe a little frozen tear, nor thy meaneſt deſire proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the poverty of thy ſpirit. This is my evening prayer: my only care next to the Love of my God is to Seek thee, to Love thee, to Thirſt for thee.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I thirſt, that ye alſo may be athirſt with this my thirſt; that is, as I haue loved you, ſo ye would have fervent love one to another, then which I account nothing more Sacred, ſo that as a good Shepheard I lay down my life for you by the only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of Love,
<hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly, I thirſt, even I the head and heart do earneſtly thirſt after all my Members: nor doth the miſery of my friends a little afflict me, of which I will no leſs upbraid the wicked than of my own, when I ſhall come in the clouds of Heaven with Majeſty and Glory, ſaying, <hi>I was athirſt, and ye gave me no drink; for what ye have done to one of the leaſt of theſe my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, ye have done it unto me,</hi> Mat. 25. Then ſhalt thou quench my thirſt, O man, if thou doſt feed my hungry ones, give
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:171778:239"/> dsink to the thirſty, cloath the naked, entertain ſtrangers, viſite thoſe that are ſick and in priſon, comfort and deliver them: then thou quencheſt my thirſt, if thou giveſt the milk of Inſtruction to the ignorant to drink, if thou break the bread of wholſome Doctrine to them, reprove ſinners, forgive the Debts and wrongs of thy brethren, patiently bear the frowardneſs and diſtempers of others, and by pure and holy Prayers help and aſſiſt them what thou canſt. This is my thirſt, which is diffuſed throughout my members, but contracted in me. Let this be quenched without the Vineger of ſorrow, or Gall of bitterneſs. Let this my great and manifold thirſt admoniſh you, and the abundant and plentifull meaſure of the Recompence which I ſhall meaſure out unto you. O man, I thirſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus far Chriſt expreſt himſelf. But what did he obtain by all this? You ſhall hear: <hi>There was ſet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>a veſſell full of Vineger,</hi> &amp;c. O inſatiable Fury! The wicked are never ſatisfied in perſecuting good men. They give Vineger to Chriſt, which being ſqueezed out of the Spunge, and dropping beſides his mouth, could not ſatisfie his thirſt, but offend his mouth, yea it would have ſpoiled his taſte: it would have troubled and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented all his inward parts. This was the beſt ſuccour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment that Chriſt found in ſo great pains and puniſhments. Never was there any ſo obnoxious to condemnation, as not to prevail for one crum of comfort, eſpecially after Sentence of death once given and received. But for the Lord that made all things there is ſimply nothing of piety at all left. All things are carryed in extreams now, becauſe he was delivered to their will. Thus the Fountain of life was dryed up, who ſaith, <hi>If any man thirſt, let him come unto me and drink.</hi> Joh. 7. He that moiſteneth the earth with dew and rain, and giveth drink to all, he is thirſty, and cannot get a drop of water. Thus Chriſt made hard ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for our Surfetting and Drunkenneſs: So did he ſuffer in all his Senſes, that man might be compleatly redeemed. But thus the world uſeth the godly in their neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Now that Vineger doth fitly ſet forth the bitterneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of the <hi>Jews</hi> hearts. For as Vineger is but degenerate Wine; ſo the <hi>Jews</hi> had degenerated from what they were at firſt: <hi>My noble Vine, how art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a ſtrange vine unto me,</hi> Jer. 2. Again, <hi>I looked that it ſhould bring
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:171778:240"/> forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes,</hi> Iſa. 5. It is to be admired in thoſe miniſters of the Lords death, yea in that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Counſell by which all theſe things were ordered, that they ſhould do every thing ſo regularly and ſo exactly, as if they had ſworn to fulfill all Propheſies in him; And therefore it is here ſaid, <hi>That the Scripture might be fulfilled:</hi> to wit, that which ſaith, <hi>They gave me Gall for my meat, and in my thirſt they gave me Vineger to drink,</hi> Pſalm 69, Hence we learn, how the world dealeth with the godly in their extremity and diſtreſs. 'For at this very day Chriſt cryeth and complaineth in the poor, and thoſe that are deſtitute of the like ſuccour and aſſiſtance: I thirſt, but the world doth give nothing but Vineger, ſcoff at, contemn, reproach, revile the afflicted. Therefore it follows: But others ſaid, <hi>Let be, let us ſee whether</hi> Elias <hi>will come to ſave him.</hi> The reſt ſhould have reproved thoſe mockers which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Vineger to Chriſt when he was in that diſtreſs, and did ſo earneſtly deſire a little drink. But there was not one to rebuke them. Nay, what theſe do with Vineger, the reſt do with bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter words. Both ſorts wounded Chriſt. So unequally is Chriſt dealt with in this world. But it laſteth but an hour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

But now and hence-forward none of all thy cheating tricks ſhall avail any thing againſt me; thy thouſand weapons and wiles ſhall not hurt me: thou haſt bent thy bow, thou haſt ſown the tares of envy, thou haſt planted the thorne of ingratitude, thou haſt ſtirred up the fury of the people, thou haſt blinded the Judges, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Executioners, thou haſt ſpit thy venome and done the worſt thou canſt. The Diſciple by thy inſtigation hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed his God, his Friends have deſpiſed him, the Souldiers cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him. Thou haſt ſhot all thy Darts, now thy Quiver is empty. Thou haſt opened the pit which thou haſt digged, but ſhalt fall into it thy ſelf. Thy wickedneſs ſhall come down upon thine own pate. Thou ſhalt not only get nothing by me, but ſhalt alſo loſe many millions of ſouls by me, I will be many a thouſand out of thy way: thy Power ſhall be weakened; thy Kingdom waſted, Iniquity ſhall come to an end. My Wiſdom ſhall overcome thy malice. For lo, whatſoever the Father hath determined (praiſed be God) is now accompliſhed; I have fully ſuffered whatever the Law and the Prophets did foretell, all that is neceſſary and may conduce to the Salvation of man. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice is offered, the Types fulfilled, the ſhadows are fled away. The Fathers command is finiſhed. The Scripture is ſulfilled. The power is at an end which thou haſt uſed, or rather abuſed over men. The rage and violence of the
<hi>Jews</hi> againſt me is at an end. Righteouſneſs it perfected, it is come up to the height, greater then which cannot poſſibly be imagined. Juſtice and Love is compleated, it is raiſed to the higheſt pitch. The Sacrifice by which alone God could be pacified, is now perfectly finiſhed. Finally, all things are now made ready. Sin is at an end. Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Righteouſneſs ſhall now take place. The Law is at an end, the Goſpel ſhall now ſucceed. Man is now redeemed, and reconciled unto God. Nothing hath been omitted, all things have been vigorouſly executed; nothing could hinder or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me from finiſhing the Myſterie of mans Redemption. An end is now put to thy Kingdom. The Kingdom of Chriſt and of God ſhall now begin. Henceforth thou ſhalt not be ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, nor ſhalt thou have ſuch power upon earth. The people that dwell in <hi>Sion</hi> ſhall not fear thee, O <hi>Aſhur.</hi> The children alſo ſhall take up Rods, they ſhall whip and ſcourge thee: they

                  <p n="1">1. By this Word of Chriſt is our Faith confirmed againſt all Hereticks, and Antichriſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Hereby alſo may we Triumph over all adverſity whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. For if we be tempted with any luſt of ſin; if death, if hell ruſh upon us, we may ſay, Why rageſt thou thus, why art thou ſo mad? Doſt not hear that Victory is at hand, and that all things are finiſhed? For however we may now be ſenſible of thoſe things, yet they are as a Serpent without poyſon, as a Bee without a ſting.

                  <p n="3">3. Whereas heretofore we were by the Law, we were very uncertain whither we ſhould go, and what ſhould become of us after this life; Nay we were moſt ſure to be hurled into Hell: now by this conſummation we are aſcertained that we ſhall be received into Heaven, if ſo be we are graffed into Chriſt by Faith. But Chriſt ſaid that all things were finiſhed in the ſame ſenſe as the Lamb <hi>is ſaid to be ſlain from the beginning of the world.</hi> Not that he was then manifeſtly ſlain, but that Chriſt being once ſlain, his death and blood was ſprinkled backward and forward, even to <hi>Adam,</hi> and to the end of the world. Thus alſo is our ſalvation finiſhed, not fully yet and indeed, but in Hope. Man is begun to be juſtified and healed.

<hi>So that there is now no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Rom. 8. Now after that word, <hi>It is finiſhed,</hi> let not the <hi>Jews</hi> expect any other, who ſhall do more then what Chriſt hath done already.</p>

Take thoſe ſouls into thy hands which I have written and printed in my hands. Theſe are my booty, the ſpoiles recovered out of the jawes of our enemy.

It is the end only and peſeverance that will prove what our works are. Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance only delivereth up the ſpirit into the hands of God; that alone doth ſtrive lawfully, and that alone ſhall be crowned. For what proweſs or praiſe is it only to begin? Who will ſuffer a tree to grow that doth but only bud and bloſſom, and never bring forth any ripe fruit? What can be more droniſh then to put on the Habegeon or Harneſs of War at home in the Houſe, and cowardly to caſt it off, and run away when the Battel is ſet? What can be more fooliſh and ridiculous then to be at vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences to lay the Foundation of a Houſe, to raiſe up the walls, and never lay the roof to cover it? What advantage is it to make a long Voyage, and ſink in the Haven? What profit is it to buy oyl and ſpill it on the ground when the Bridegroom is coming? To what purpoſe is it to be zealous for a time, to climb up to Heaven, to make his neſt among the Stars, to walk with the children of God in the midſt of a fiery Furnace, and at laſt to ſink down to hell, to be beſotted in ſin, and of a yong Angel to become an old decrepite Devil? Remember him therefore who loved us to the end, and perſevered in his love to us even to the end upon the Croſs, and will ſave none but ſuch as perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere in good even to the end, to wit, in the imitation of his Croſs.</p>
                  <p>Now when our Lord Chriſt had uttered this his laſt Word, he bowed down his head, and gave up the ghoſt. He bowed his head; Firſt, as taking his leave of the world. Secondly, he would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by comfort us, by letting us know that he is not croſs or froward towards us. Firſt, it is very ſignificantly expreſſed in that it is not ſaid that he died, but that he gave up the ghoſt: <hi>for he had power to lay down his life,</hi> John 10. Secondly, he is ſaid to give up the ghoſt, to let us know, that when our ſouls are looſed from the fleſh, they ſhould be commended to the Divine Goodneſs, as into the hands of a moſt dear Father.</p>

Thus our High-Prieſt hath finiſhed his evening Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:171778:244"/> Thus the Life of the world died, the Fountain of true Light was ecclipſed, thus the Spring of all Life, in whom all things live waxed dry, that he might deliver them that were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to death. Thus that celeſtial Wedlock between the holieſt ſoul and the pureſt fleſh was diſſolved and divorced by the ſword of Death, that we who were condemned might be recovered to the indiſſoluble Union of his Beatitude. Thus the Organ of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, the Harp of the true <hi>David,</hi> the moſt melodious Voyce of Jeſus ſunk into the ſilence of cruel Death. Thus thoſe Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lights of his moſt gracious Eyes were darkened by Death. Thus that moſt ſacred Breaſt of Eternal Wiſdom, and the Store-Houſe of the Treaſures of Grace, is deprived of his life. Thus he Redeemed us from our ſins with ſo great a price; a greater then which is not to be found among all the creatures in the world: thus did he ſatisfie the Father for our diſobedience with ſuch obedience as was even unto death. O how great was that grief, when that moſt holy Soul which was Wedded and United to that moſt holy Body with an indiſſoluble bond of Love, muſt be ſeparated now and torn aſunder by a violent death, and that moſt holy Life die! Never was there death more bitter, becauſe never was there man ſo ſenſibly ſenſible of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Wo be to thee therefore, O thou ungodly Synagogue, who art more fierce and cruel then any wild beaſt; thou haſt devoured the life of Jeſus, who out of the Paternal Piety was ſent unto thee to be thy Father and thy Husband.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. O how grievous will thy Accuſation be for rending and tearing the body of Chriſt. And wo be to thee thou ingratefull heart, thou hard heart, harder then any ſtone, who doſt not break and melt at the remembrance of ſo great a Sacrifice for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating thy hainous ſins: how ſtrictly will that innocent blood be required at thy hands? Here then, O man, O generation of <hi>Adam,</hi> here knock thy boſom and beat thy breaſt; conſider well and think of this death. The chiefeſt and choiſeſt good doth here hang upon the Croſs. Here the Eternal Wiſdom offereth it ſelf to be ſeen naked. Here the tree carried the Treaſure and Price of the whole world. O ſinners, here dieth the Son of God. I ſay here the Son of the moſt High, the King of Heaven, and Lord of Earth dieth: Nay he dies on the Croſs like a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor in the midſt of Thieves, in greateſt miſery and anguiſh
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:171778:244"/> and ſhame. It was we, O ye ſons of men that brought this juſt One to this unjuſt and unworthy ſuffering. Our ſins were the cauſe of this his great Paſſion. Here the word of the Sacrament is made good, <hi>This is my body, which is given for you. This is my blood which is ſhed for you, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Here now we underſtand what Chriſt meant by theſe ſacred and holy words, becauſe all things are here ſeen with the eyes. Here that Article of our moſt holy Faith hath its Foundation: <hi>He ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>was crucified, dead, and buried.</hi> Think on this, O man, imprint theſe things in thy heart, that thy very inward parts may be made ſenſible how that we men, we ſinners were guilty of this death. We ſhould have hung on the croſs, and died, yea and have been eternally ſcorcht in Hell, but that our moſt holy Lord ſtept in, and ſaid, I will hang on the croſs, and die for all men. Take me, and ſmite me the Shepheard, but let the ſheep go free. I will pay what I own not. I will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take other mens debt. I will even all accounts, I will make peace, and bring all things to a good end and iſſue. Think ſeriouſly on theſe things Believers. Be pleaſed to accept this Miniſtry of Chriſt, and highly prize it. For this his death is your life. For us thus to die, is to live, and eſcape death. This weakneſs is our ſtrength and fortitude. Theſe wounds and ſcars are our health and ſoundneſs. This malediction is our benediction; this curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is our bleſſing. This ſhame is our glory. This croſs is our ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Court and Palace. Theſe Nayles are our Salvation. Lift up your hearts, O ye Faithfull, lift up your hearts in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe wonderfull things. There was War between Chriſt and the Devil; the field was pitched, the battel ſet, and Chriſt got the Victory. Let us therefore give him thanks who was pleaſed through his infinite love with ſuch hazard and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to Redeem us.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In this expiation of Chriſt, firſt we ſee that verified, which he ſaid before in <hi>John</hi> 10, <hi>I have power to lay down my life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2, Here we ſee that the works of God are againſt reaſon. For who ever hearing that Chriſt was the ſon of God, and ſeeing ſuch great Miracles which he had done before, could at all believe, that God ſhould ſo far wink at wicked men, as to let them kill ſo great and ſo worthy a man! Again, who would believe that the true had then its beginning, ſeeing him die ſo ſhamefull a
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:171778:245"/> death? But this is the ancient and uſual cuſtom of God to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and carry on his works by ſtrange, unlikely and contrary means. It was indeed the pleaſure of God to cauſe great and mighty boughs and limms to grow on this tree of Chriſt. He intended to build up and quicken the Church. This he did by a work diſagreeable and repugnant to life, and nothing of kin to it; to wit, the death of Chriſt, by which he quickened and made the Church alive. Hence is that of <hi>John</hi>
12. <hi>Except a grain of wheat die, it bringeth forth no fruit: but if it die, it beareth much fruit.</hi> The Edifice or building of the Church did not then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed appear while Chriſt yet hanged on the croſs, for here you ſee nothing but his death and burial, as at Seed-time there is no ſhew of Harveſt. But as in Summer the ſeed that was ſown doth ſpring up, ſo after the Reſurrection the living Church ſprouted out of the dead and dry body of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From this Expiation of Chriſt we are diligently to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what puniſhments we ſhall endure, if we perſevere in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, inaſmuch as God did ſuffer his innocent Son to be ſo cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly and inhumanly dealt with for others ſins. <hi>Daughters of</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, ſaith he, <hi>weep not for me, but for your ſelves,</hi> i.e. Learn ye by my ſuffering, what ye have deſerved. If this be done to me who am guiltleſs, and harmleſs, and blameleſs, what ſhall be done to you who are faulty and guilty? The Text follows:</p>

                     <hi>And behold, the Vail of the Temple was rent in twain, from the top to the bottom, and the earth did quake, and the Rocks rent, and the graves were opened, and many bodies of Saints Which ſlept, aroſe, and came out of the graves aſter his Reſurrection, and went into the Holy City, and appeared unto many.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hitherto we have ſeen the weak things of Chriſt. Now his Majeſty ſhines forth and ſhews it ſelf; diſcovering who, what, and how great a one he is that now hangeth on the tree. Here then conſider what mighty Signs and Wonders were wrought at the death of Chriſt. For thoſe ſignes do ſhew the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Innocency of Chriſt, and withall do reprove and condemn the hard hearts of unbelievers. Men would not be troubled at the death of this man, but lo the Elements are much diſquiered at it. Flinty ſtones were here ſoftened, yea broken: and thou heart of fleſh art thou turned into a ſtone! doſt thou
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:171778:245"/> ſtand gazing on the Paſſion of thy Lord, and art nothing affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or moved thereat! There are ſome who ſay, we ſhould be jocund and jovial, laugh and be merry at the Paſſion of Chriſt. Surely it was then no time for the Inhabitants of
<hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to laugh, when Heaven and Earth were thus diſturbed and moved at the death of Chriſt. Indeed afterwards we may well rejoyce for the ſaving death of Chriſt, as that by which we are redeemed from eternal death. But nevertheleſs the ſame Paſſion ought to affect and move us as we are men, unleſs we ſhould altogether become inhumane, and from men be degenerated into ſtones. to ſay nothing of what great joy it might be unto us, if we did but conſider the cauſe of this miſerable Death, even our ſins, which ought bitterly to be bewailed in this Paſſion of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now all theſe terrible Signs which are here deſcribed, were both within and without the Temple, and did manifeſtly declare the wrath of God againſt the unrighteouſneſs of the whole world, for the purging where of the moſt High Majeſtie gave his only begotten Son to die. And becauſe men would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the ſame, therefore the Elements publiſh it. <hi>If theſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would cry out.</hi> Beſides, by the Paſſion of Chriſt, and after it. God intended to make a great alteration in the world. Which alteration theſe Signs did foreſhew and uſher in:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Vail of the Temple was rent, to ſhew, that by the death of Chriſt the Holies of Holies are revealed, that by Chriſt there is an open entrance for us unto God, that the way to the Temple of God is made open and plain, that the flaming Sword is removed from Paradiſe, that the Wall of partition is broken down, that thoſe things that ſeparated us from God are taken out of the way; that what was hid and kept cloſe before,
<note place="margin">Epheſ. 3.</note> is now made known, to wit, that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be co-heirs, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partners, and incorporated and become one body with the <hi>Jews.</hi> Finally, that all ſhadows and figures were now ceaſed, and that the Truth it ſelf was come and did ſhine forth. Therefore the Vail of the Temple was rent. So that now we may look into the Sanctuary, which the Vail hindered before. The Myſteries of the Kingdom of God, which in the Old Teſtament were vailed and covered, are now brought to light by Chriſt, who came a
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:171778:246"/> Light into the world. Henceforth therefore the <hi>Gentiles</hi> may behold the Myſterie of God; that is, they may acknowledge and learn the word and truth of God, becauſe the Vail is rent, and the <hi>Jew</hi> is not better then the <hi>Gentile.</hi> Would to God alſo that Vail that is upon the hearts of the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſpiritually rent, that they might truly both hear and underſtand the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 3. And that they alſo might acknowledge Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Origen</hi> ſpeaks of a twofold Vail, as <hi>Paul</hi> alſo doth: the firſt of which is rent already and taken away, but the ſecond yet remaineth, and hideth thoſe things which we ſhall ſee in the life to come. <hi>For now we know but in part only, but then we ſhall know perfectly,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. I ſay, the firſt Vail is taken away: ſo that we may know many things of God, which before were kept cloſe from us. But the ſecond Vail yet remaineth: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at preſent we cannot perfectly know the things of God. In brief, <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets are now made clear and plain; but as to the Hiſtorical part the vail of the Temple is rent al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. Therefore the <hi>Romans</hi> might enter, as alſo they did. The High Prieſts of the <hi>Jews</hi> were wont to rent their garments, when they heard any thing that was wicked or blaſphemous. This doth the Temple of God alſo now do, renting its garment, being as it were amazed, and taking in great indignation the wrong and injuries offered to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A ſecond ſign was the Earth-quake, the earth abhorring as it were that ſuch wickedneſs ſhould be committed upon it, and abominating the impiety of the <hi>Jews</hi> done to the Univerſal Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of all things. It did alſo foreſhew that the whole Earth ſhould be moved and ſhaken at the preaching of the Apoſtles, as was foretold in
<hi>Haggai, I will ſhake the Heaven and the earth, and the deſire of all Nations ſhall come,</hi> Hag. 2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third ſign was the renting of the Rocks. This was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more then the other. For we read of many earth-quakes, but not of any Rocks rent before, which was now done to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the obſtinacy and hardneſs of the <hi>Jews.</hi> And it did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhew, either that the writings of the Prophets ſhould be ſo rent at the coming of Chriſt, that all might ſee what was in the inſide of them: Or rather it did ſignifie that the hard hearts of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould be rent, that they might receive the ſeed of Gods Word. For the Word of God and his Divine Power was
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:171778:246"/> now about to pierce all things that were never ſo hard, never ſo faſt and firm.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A fourth ſign was the riſing of ſome dead bodies. This exceeded all the foregoing ſigns. In this ſign there was a ſpecial kind of Gods power ſeen. Theſe <hi>dead,</hi> (Joh. 5.) heard the voyce of the Son of God when he with a loud cry gave up the ghoſt. At this cry their graves opened, that the dead which yet lived might again go out of their graves: not before, but after the Reſurrection of Chriſt. For he was the firſt born of the dead, and the firſt fruits of them that ſlept. Whereby was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewed, firſt that the hope of our reſurrection is only by the death of Chriſt; ſecondly, that every man ſhall riſe again in his own time. The <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> doth Emphatically add, that they who thus aroſe, came into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and appeared unto many, that none might think it was a phantaſme or deluſion. By this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe was foreſhewed, that many ſnners ſhould riſe out of their ſins and the death of their ſouls to a new life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. ſo as to be ſeen afterward in the holy Church, exerciſing themſelves in the works of Life and Spirit; to wit, good works, whereby others may be moved to glorifie the Father, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. The graves were therefore opened, to ſhew that death was ſwallowed up by the death of Chriſt: for ſo it was foretold by the Prophet, <hi>O death I will be thy death,</hi> Hoſ. 13. Thus we ſee,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That when Chriſt died, every creature ſuffered with him. Only the <hi>Jews</hi> hearts remained hard, whom obſtinate ſinners alſo do now imitate, who by their ſins do ſtill crucifie the Son of God; notwithſtanding they have heard and ſeen ſo many ſigns and wonders, they do not yet fear nor rend their hearts: ſo far are they from riſing again, and confeſſing Chriſt to be the Son of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here we ſee, that the glory or glorifying of Chriſt did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin preſently upon his death; ſo alſo will our glorifying begin immediately after our death; and we who now ſeem to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed in this life, ſhall then appear gloriouſly in glory, as may be ſeen in the begger <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who when he lived was hated of all men, but when he died, he was carried by the Angels into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> boſom,
<hi>Luke</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>It is to be noted, that at the death of Chriſt there were ſeven Signs, which do yet likewiſe concur in every juſtified perſon. For

                  <p n="2">2. Internal things muſt be revealed to him; that is, he muſt have a true ſight of his ſins, acknowledge his own filthineſs: this is to rend the Vail, under which ſuch ſins were hid, that they did not appear ſo foul and filthy as they are.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then he muſt fear and be aſtoniſhed at the ſight of ſuch ugly ſins, and ſo defiled a conſcience: this is for the Earth to quake; for no man is afraid or troubled in conſcience, but he that ſees his ſin and feels the weight thereof.</p>

<note place="margin">Mat. 27.54. Mar. 15.39. Luke 23.47.</note> and they that were with him, watching Ieſus, ſaw that he ſo cryed out, and gave up the ghoſt, and ſaw the Earth-quake, and thoſe things that were done, they feared greatly, and glorified God, ſaying, Truly this was a Righteous man, and the Son of God. And all the people that came together to that ſight, beholding the things that were done, ſmote their breaſts and returned. And all his acquaintance and the women that followed him from</hi> Galilee, <hi>ſtood afar off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding theſe things. Among whom was</hi> Mary Magdalen, <hi>and</hi> Mary <hi>the mother of</hi> James <hi>the leſs, and the mother of</hi> Joſes, <hi>and</hi> Salome <hi>the mother of</hi> Zebedees <hi>children: who alſo when he was in</hi> Galile, <hi>followed him, and miniſtred unto him, and many other women
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:171778:248"/> which came up with him from</hi> Galile
<hi>to</hi> Jeruſalem.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto of the Signs which happened at Chriſts death. Now we ſhall ſee what fruit followed from thence. Firſt, the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion and they that were with him, which were <hi>Romans,</hi> were hereby converted to the Faith, glorified God, confeſſed that Jeſus who was crucified, was a juſt man and the Son of God, &amp; conſequently that he was put to death wrongfully. And what wonder? Should ſuch great Miracles which were wrought in Heaven, and in Earth, and in the Temple, and on the Dead, have no effect, and bring forth no fruit? Bleſſed therefore are they that ſearch out his wondrous things, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 119.18. Now if Chriſt could do theſe things with the Elements at his death, what might he have done upon them that crucified him? What <hi>Iew</hi> can ſay but that God did here manifeſtly ſhew himſelf? Great were their ancient Miracles in <hi>Aegypt,</hi> in the red Sea, at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> and in the Wilderneſs. But compare them with thoſe that were here wrought at the death of Chriſt, with thoſe at his Reſurrection (which was the greateſt Miracle of all) with thoſe for forty dayes after, at the Aſcention and ſending of the Holy Ghoſt, and you will ſee that the riſe and beginning of the New Teſtament was far more excellent and glorious then that of the Old Teſtament.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Centurion and they that were with him could think no other, but that all theſe ſigns were wrought for the ſake of this Jeſus. Therefore they excuſe his innocency, pronounce him Righteous, and do not conclude him to be ſuch a one as the <hi>Jews</hi> accuſed him to be, and as <hi>Pilate</hi> had condemned him. And which is more, they confeſs him to be the Son of God, which they gathered and concluded from the ſigns which they ſaw, Lo, this did the <hi>Gentiles</hi> believe, who had neither the Law nor the Prophets.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The people which came together to that ſight (for ſo is Chriſt truly with thoſe that are his, made a Spectacle to the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. A ſign and wonder, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.) <hi>ſmote their breaſts, and returned:</hi> as if they had ſaid, O God, what ſtrange and new things have we ſeen and heard to day? Truly, truly, this ſhall be our Meſſias. O how baſely have we uſed him, to whom we did owe, and ſhould have done all honour and reſpect? This innocent blood will be required of us and our generation. Here
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:171778:249"/> then was fulfilled what Chriſt had foretold: <hi>When ye have lift up the ſon of man, then ſhall ye know that I am he,</hi> John 8. <hi>even the Meſſias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here we ſee that he that dieth for the Truth, doth more at his death then when he lived. Thus Chriſt converted more at his death then in his life. For when he ſhed his blood it never ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed crying: Whence it is that the Elect who do through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance afflict the godly, yet obtain they mercy, but the Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate are damned. His acquaintance, eſpecially thoſe Women from <hi>Galile,</hi> ſtood and diligently beheld theſe things; for they lookt for no ſuch Spectacle, but their mind now preſaged that after ſo ſad a Tragedie they ſhould ſee better dayes. They ſtood afar off for fear that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <hi>Thou haſt put away mine Acquaintance far from me, lover and friend from my miſery,</hi> Pſalm 88. Again, <hi>He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are verily eſtranged from me,</hi> Job 19. They ſtood aloof, yet they ſaw and conſidered what was done. It was a ſight worth the ſeeing, to the beholding whereof all the world ſhould have run together.</p>
                  <p>But who can expreſs the ſorrow and grief of thoſe Holy Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, eſpecially of the Virgin-mother, when they ſaw him hang ſo ſhamfully on the croſs, for whom they had done ſo much, and to whom they had miniſtred, not only in <hi>Galile,</hi> but alſo in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea?</hi> But they are much to be commended, that the fear nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Jews,</hi> nor of the <hi>Romans</hi> could hinder them from following after Chriſt, and that they would no more forſake him when he was dead, then when he was living. This is to take good and bad together with ones Friend. The Diſciples fled, but the Womenkind ſtood it out, as being willing to repair and make amends for the wrong done to all mankind in Paradiſe. And becauſe thoſe holy Women did ſo ſtoutly ſtand it out, and tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee the end of the holy Paſſion, they were likewiſe count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy to have the firſt ſight of Chriſt after his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They were laſt with Chriſt when he dyed, and firſt with him when he lived. A godly man will learn many good things from thoſe Women, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The</hi> Jews <hi>therefore,
<note place="margin">John 19.31.</note> becauſe it was the preparation, that the bodies ſhould not remain upon the Croſs on the Sabbath-day (for that Sabbath-day was an High day) beſought</hi> Pilate
<hi>that their
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:171778:249"/> legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. Then came the Souldiers and brake the legs of the firſt, and of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Ieſus, and ſaw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs. But one of the Souldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide, and forthwith came thereout blood and water. And he that ſaw it bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and his Record is true, and he knoweth that he ſaith true, that ye might believe. For theſe things were done that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be fulfilled,</hi> A bone of him ſhall not be broken. <hi>And again, another Scripture ſaith,</hi> They ſhall look on him whom they pierced.</p>
                  <p>We have heard of the death of the Lord Jeſus, and how it was bewailed by the Women of <hi>Galile:</hi> his burial is yet behind, which the
<hi>Iews</hi> indeed attempted, but God reſerved the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity thereof to be performed by holy and good men. The day when theſe things were done, was the preparation: that is, a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory day to the following Sabbath, which was called the Sabbath of the Paſsover, becauſe it fell out in the Paſchal week. Whence it was celebrated more honourably then the other Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths. And this the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> ſhews, when he ſaith, <hi>For that Sabbath day was an High day.</hi> This was a double Feſtival, both in reſpect of the Sabbath, and alſo of the Paſchal Week, which was wholly Feſtival. When this Sabbath drew nigh, thoſe bloody men thought it a diſhonour if the bodies of the ſlain ſhould hang before their gates in the view of all men. Therefore leſt the Devotion and Religious obſervation of the Feaſt-day ſhould be clouded with ſo ſad and dolefull a Spectacle, they deſired by any means that they ſhould be taken down and removed before the Feaſt began. A perverſe and prepoſterous religion indeed it was, to intend to celebrate the Feaſt ſo holily, the entrance whereof they had polluted with ſo great impiety: They would keep the Law, and yet had juſt now killed the Lord of the Law. The Law by which they tye themſelves to this obſervation was this: The Lord commanding that they that were crucified ſhould be buried the ſame night, <hi>Deut.</hi> 21. This Law was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given in reference to Chriſt. For the Law written by the Finger of God, in reſpect of him only who was then to be cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, did take care that all that were crucified ſhould be bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame night: whereas there was no ſuch Law or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:171778:250"/> concerning others that ſhould ſuffer a violent death. God indeed could have preſerved the body of Chriſt alſo unburied from ſhame and violence. But ſo it was expedient for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of the Saints, that this body of this dead man ſhould be united to them in the graves, that by it they might obtain a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection. For as it was meet that the ſoul of Chriſt ſhould go down into Hell to deliver the ſouls of the Fathers: ſo it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooved that his body ſhould reach their bodies, that ſo he might raiſe them up again, and thereby a perfect Reſurrection might be hoped for. To this Law do theſe wicked men now pretend. And now they begin to think of the religious obſervation of the Feaſt, as if they had now omitted nothing, but had done every thing as it ought to be done. Thus Hypocrites look only at the Ceremonies, mean while leaving the greater and weightier works of Righteouſneſs undone, and think that all will go well with them, let them ſin never ſo much, ſo long as they leave out no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the Ceremonies. So here they are very carefull to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that Law which was only for civility and humanity; but in the mean while ſwerving from, and prevaricating the whole Law. Yet who would have ſaid but that thoſe were very holy men? Who could have ſuſpected that they would have killed Chriſt contrary to all Law, who were ſuch zealous and devout obſervers of the Law? But thus doth Hypocriſie uſe to palliate and hide its iniquity.</p>
                  <p>But under pretence of this Law and reverence of the Feaſt, they addreſs themſelves to <hi>Pilate:</hi> they entreat him that the bodies of thoſe that were put to death might be taken down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the evening, that nothing might hinder it, and that the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour would give command to have their bones broken, that they might die the ſooner. This they pretended to <hi>Pilate.</hi> But there was ſomewhat elſe did bite them. They were afraid leſt the people ſhould repent of what they had done, and believe in Chriſt, becauſe of the ſignes that were ſhewed at his death; for then they heard the various judgements and opinions of men concerning Chriſt by reaſon of his Miracles. Therefore they make Poſt haſte to get him down and bury him out of the way; for they were in hopes that he would quickly and totally be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, if he were but once removed out of ſight, and that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any hereafter would upbraid them with the death of ſo
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:171778:250"/> great a man. But all in vain, their project is to no purpoſe; for they can hide neither Chriſts Glory, nor their own ſhame.</p>
                  <p>But wicked men eaſily obtain what they deſire of a wicked Judge. The Souldiers alſo are at hand, ready to gratifie the <hi>Jews;</hi> they break the legs of the Thieves hanging on the croſs, and were about to ſtrike the body of Chriſt, but that they ſaw he was dead already; which was that which hindered them, and not any pity of theirs. Nor need they further torture him, who was now inſenſible of any torments. And as Chriſt though he was dead, yet had none of his bones broken: ſo the godly are afflicted indeed, but not deſtroyed: and as all their hairs are numbred, ſo all their bones are preſerved, that nothing can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall them without the good Will of God. But therefore Chriſt would not have his legs broken, becauſe the bones which My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtically in the Scriptures do ſignifie power and ſtrength, would preach nothing of Myſterie to us if they ſhould be broken. But on the contrary, whereas his legs were preſerved whole, it ſignifieth thus much to us, that als his wayes (which in the <hi>Canticles</hi> are deſcribed by his Legs) are ſtraight and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable.</p>
                  <p>But however they had no need to break Chriſts legs, becauſe he was dead already, yet one of the Souldiers willing to pleaſe the
<hi>Jews,</hi> thruſt his Javelin into his ſide, for which <hi>Pilate</hi> gave him no ſuch commiſſion. But God ordered this alſo thus to be done: Firſt, that the Scripture in <hi>Zachary</hi> here quoted might be fulfilled. Secondly, that the Figure of <hi>Adam</hi> ſleeping might be explained, who had his Rib taken out of him when he was aſleep, of which the Woman was made,
<hi>Gen.</hi> 2. And it is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly expreſſed, that the ſide of Chriſt was not wounded, but opened: to let us know,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is an open way for us to the heart of God. Here is our Refuge, that we may hide our ſelves in the clefts of this Rock: for there, and there only we ſhall be ſafe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The opening of this ſide ſignifieth, that the door of Life is open to us, whence Sacraments flow forth, without which no man can come to the true Life. For as <hi>Eve</hi> was formed out of <hi>Adams</hi> ſide when he was aſleep, ſo the Church was formed out of Chriſts ſide when he died upon the croſs. Therefore it is ſaid
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:171778:251"/> here, that when Chriſts ſide was pierced, preſently there came forth blood and water. Which out-flowing was both very Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous and Myſterious. For we are Redeemed by blood, and with water are we waſhed: So that the death of Chriſt was both our redemption and purification. And it is obſervable, that neither only blood nor only water came forth. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out blood water could do nothing, nor had our redemption ſtood us in ſuch ſtead, if we ſhould have been and continued as bad as we were before, and not been cleanſed withall. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there might be wherewith to waſh us from our ſins, water which only waſheth away the filth of the body, is joyned to blood, which is the price of our Redemption, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction thereto did it receive Vertue, that it might be fit to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with the Holy Spirit to the waſhing away the inviſible ſpots and ſtains of ſin. This was foretold in the Prophet,
<hi>There ſhall be a Fountain opened to the Houſe of</hi> David, <hi>for the waſhing of the ſinner, and the menſtruous or unclean,</hi> Zach. 13. Whereby Sinner is underſtood the Heathen people, and by the Unclean is meant the <hi>Iew,</hi> who ſinned againſt the Law. Therefore blood and water are the two undoubted Objects of our Faith and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Church:
<note place="margin">The Maſs.</note> to wit, the
<hi>Supper</hi> and <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> The Blood was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins, and Baptiſm was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the forgiveneſs of ſins, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.38. &amp; 22.16. Such great ſalvation did there flow to us out of the Wound of our Lord. For by theſe two is the Church built up. By Water we are new born, by Blood are we nouriſhed. Or thus, theſe two, blood and water, ſignifie that both life and comfort flow to us out of the Paſſion of Chriſt. The life is in the blood; and water in the Scriptures doth moſt commonly ſignifie Conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here then are we confirmed, not only whilſt we live, but when we die too, that we are perſwaded there is life in death, and that our life is hid in God. Well therefore may <hi>Auguſtine</hi> here cry out,
<note place="margin">O mors, unde mortui revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſcunt!</note> O the Death, by which the dead do live again! What can be more pure then that Blood? What more healthful then that Wound? But why Chriſts bones ſhould not be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and yet his ſide pierced, <hi>John</hi> brings in and alledgeth two Teſtimonies: one out of the Law, another out of the Prophets. But firſt he doth affirm that theſe things were true by his own witneſs, that none might think it incredible which he ſaid of
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:171778:251"/> the blood and water flowing out of the ſide of Chriſt when he was dead. For it is againſt Nature that blood and water ſhould come out of the ſide of a dead man. <hi>John</hi> therefore doth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he ſaw it. And that his Teſtimony is valid and true, may appear by this, in that he did not write only of the glorious, but alſo the meaner things of Chriſt and of his abaſement. But he produceth two other Teſtimonies more: that by the <hi>mouth of two or three witneſſes every word may be eſtabliſhed,</hi> Deut. 17.</p>
                  <p>The Teſtimony out of the Law is, <hi>Ye ſhall not break a bone thereof,</hi> Exod. 12. which was concerning the paſchal Lamb. And who is that paſchal Lamb but Jeſus who was crucified and offered up upon the Croſs? For he is our Paſsover, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor,</hi> 5. By this Quotation it plainly appears, that <hi>Iohn</hi> did not ſo much intend to cite the Hiſtory, as to put us in mind of what this Hiſtory did ſignifie; to wit, that this Jeſus was the true Paſsover, which was ſignified by the legal Lamb. But even this Scripture doth confirm us, that the bones of the paſchal Lamb are not broken. Indeed the power of darkneſs might ſo far rage againſt Chriſt, as to take away his life and glory in the view of the world; But his bones, that is, his life and glory with God it could not break or deprive him of. The ſame happeneth to all the Saints; let the wicked rage as much as they will, yet they break not the bones of the godly; that is, no power or force of theirs is ſo great, but Faith will overcome it. For Faith is the power of God unto ſalvation to every one that believeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>The other Teſtimony is taken out of <hi>Zachary: They ſhall look on him whom they have pierced,</hi> Zach. 12. This in the firſt place is referred to the godly, who ſhall look on Chriſt crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and acknowledge that he ſo ſuffered for their ſins. To the ſame purpoſe alſo is that in the ſame <hi>Zachary: And they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only ſon.</hi> This place here cited may alſo be referred to the wicked: and then it is all one with that where it is ſaid,
<hi>Vengeance is mine, I will repay it.</hi> For when Divine Vengeanceis a long time forborn, the Lord doth by theſe and ſuch like words ſhew that the wicked do prevail and get the upper hand in this world: but ſo, as that they kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with their own Weapons. The more they proſper in

Being blinded therefore, they run headlong into the moſt heavy Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God. For as it is with a man in his ſleep that dreameth he is fighting with, and beating his enemy; but when he awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he finds that he hath buffetted himſelf with his own fiſts: ſo he that doth wrong a godly man, doth ſeem indeed to have the better of him, either becauſe of the godly mans weakneſs, or becauſe vengeance is prolonged. But if we well weigh it, he doth wound himſelf with his own Weapon. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> but to ſpeak more properly and more truly, he did thereby oppreſs himſelf. <hi>Saul</hi> perſecuted
<hi>David:</hi> one may better ſay, in ſo doing he did perſecute himſelf. The <hi>Iews</hi> pierced Chriſt: but in deed and in truth they did more deeply pierce their own hearts, according to that, <hi>Whoſo caſteth a ſtone on high, caſteth it on his own head,</hi> Eccl. 27.25. The wicked therefore ſhall look on him whom they have pierced, and ſhall ſee that they did not kill and condemn the righteous, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And now when the even was come (becauſe it was the Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<note place="margin">Mar. 15.42. Mat. 27.57. Luke 23.50. Iohn
19.38.</note> that is, the day before the Sabbath)</hi> Joſeph <hi>of</hi> Arimathea <hi>a rich man, an honourable Counſellour, a good man and a juſt; The ſame had not conſented to the counſell and deed of them, who alſo himſelf waited for the Kingdom of God, being a Diſciple of Jeſus, but ſecretly for fear of the</hi> Jews, <hi>he came, and went in boldly unto</hi> Pilate, <hi>and beſought him that he might take away the body of Ieſus. And</hi> Pilate <hi>marvelled if he were already dead, and calling unto him the Centurion, he asked him if he had been any while dead. And when he knew it of the Centurion, he gave the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Ieſus unto</hi> Joſeph; <hi>and</hi> Joſeph <hi>bought fine linnen. And there came alſo</hi> Nicodemus, <hi>who at the firſt came to Ieſus by night, and brought a mixture of Myrrhe and Aloes about an hundred pound weight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was now time to bury the body of Chriſt, but ſcarce any man durſt undertake it becauſe of the raging madneſs of the
<hi>Jews.</hi> Yet lo here are two who as it were unthought of, offer themſelves to do it, but not without the counſell and pre-ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God. The <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> do diligently ſet down and exactly deſcribe both their perſon, and their care in the burial
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:171778:253"/> of Chriſt. It was and is a matter moſt worthy for us to know and imitate, which was not done without great danger.</p>
                  <p>The firſt was called <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> who was of
<hi>Arimathea,</hi> whence <hi>Elkanah</hi> alſo in the firſt of
<hi>Samuel</hi> had his beginning. Now this <hi>Joſeph</hi> was an honeſt, and a juſt, and a Rich man, which three may well ſtand together, though they are very rare to be found: <hi>Nicodemus</hi> is not ſo much commended here, becauſe he is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe mentioned to his praiſe elſwhere in the Goſpel; He was a Lawyer: but <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was a Senator. But in this they agreed, that both of them did affect and love Chriſts Doctrine, and eſteemed it as the Word of God: yet they choſe rather to be Chriſts Diſciples ſecretly then openly. And the reaſon was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their riches and reputation, wherein they did excel, and which they could not preſently forſake, nor yet would they reject Chriſts Doctrine. But that both of them loved Chriſt, did ſufficiently appear by what they did for him. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had formerly ſtood up in the Council of the
<hi>Phariſees</hi> in deſence of Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 7. And
<hi>Ioſeph</hi> openly refuſed to conſent to the death of Chriſt. They were juſt men indeed, endowed with great gifts of Nature, in whom alſo the Spirit of the Lord did begin to ſparkle out: I wiſh we had more ſuch men now in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, Parliaments, Conventions, Convocations, Aſſemblies that would withſtand wicked men and their Deſigns, and would do but as theſe two here did.</p>
                  <p>We are therefore diligently to take notice of theſe two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. For firſt we ſee here, that there is no time or age ſo bad, but God doth preſerve and deliver thoſe that are his, and that ſome good men at leaſt are to be found in the worſt of times. Thus in the dayes of
<hi>Elias,</hi> when every place was full &amp; abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Idols, and falſe Worſhips, yet then God reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeven thouſand men that had not bowed their knees to <hi>Baal.</hi> So at the time of Chriſts death there was nothing but ſcandal, impiety and diſtruſt of Chriſt. For ſome did wickedly revile, others out of weakneſs denyed him. Some were offended at his ſhamefull death, and never expected any more good from him. But theſe two, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> do here openly ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who ſtedfaſtly continued in the Faith, being nothing ſhaken either by the impiety or unbelief of others. Indeed the
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:171778:254"/> Faith of theſe men was to be admired, which is made more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt by the Antitheſis or oppoſition. For they were both rich men, both Potent, both accounted juſt men before the world. The one a Senator, the other a <hi>Phariſee.</hi> But all theſe, Riches, Authority, Power, Repute, and Worldly Honour they neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, regarded not, and expoſed themſelves to trouble and danger to ſerve Chriſt even when he was dead. Who compelled them to do this? Who forced them to it? Was it it their kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Jeſus? Civil Friendſhip will go but to the Altar, Death will put a period to it. Faith only carried them thus far, which is of ſuch force and power that it will draw a Believer from all ſenſible things, and ſet him upon things inſenſible. Riches, Power and Senatorian Dignity were ſenſible things. But Faith fixt theſe two upon eternal Power and Wealth, having pluckt them off from thoſe things. The ſame Energy and vigour of Faith was there in <hi>Abraham,</hi> who forſook his Countrey, his Fathers eſtate, and his Friends, and followed after thoſe unknown and inviſible things which God had promiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Joſeph</hi> therefore being inſtigated and ſtrengthened with this Faith, went boldly to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and confidently craved of him the body of Jeſus, which none of his Diſciples durſt ask for. <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> preſently grants it him, for ſo was the Divine Grace pleaſed to work and order it. <hi>Pilate</hi> had adjudged Chriſt to die, but fore againſt his will. Now he enquires of the Centurion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Chriſt were already dead, before he would grant his body to
<hi>Ioſeph.</hi> He could not eaſily be perſwaded that Chriſt ſhould be dead ſo ſoon, whereas others oftentimes uſe to live till the next day with their legs whole. And becauſe they were ſo long a dying, they uſed to ſet Souldiers to watch the croſs to keep them leſt they ſhould chance to make an eſcape; which here alſo they did, as the
<hi>Evangeliſts</hi> witneſs. But <hi>Pilate</hi> knew not that
<hi>Chriſt had power to lay down his life,</hi> Joh. 10. Therefore he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that he ſhould be ſo ſoon dead.</p>
                  <p>Nor do the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> deſcribe only the perſons of theſe two men, but alſo the care of them both, and what either of them brought to the interring of Chriſt. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> brought linnen; and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> brought a mixture of Myrrhe and Aloes about an hundred pound weight. This <hi>Nicodemus</hi> is commended in the
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:171778:254"/> Goſpel for other things, for that he came to Chriſt by night, and that he defended him before the
<hi>Phariſees.</hi> Therefore he doth happily finiſh what he had well begun. Now Chriſt would have a glorious and ſumptuous Funeral!</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe he had made ſatisfaction for the ſin of man, and it was now time that his Glory ſhould appear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Scripture might be ſulfilled, which ſaith, <hi>And his ſepulchre ſhall be glorious,</hi> as the vulgar reading is, or <hi>his Reſt ſhall be Glory,</hi> Iſa. 11.10.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To let us know, that our glory hath it riſe or beginning from death. For the glory of Worldly things is ſwallowed up in the grave.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. To give us to underſtand, that there is a ſure and certain Crown of Glory laid up for them that ſtrive lawfully after their fight is finiſhed, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith; Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the Righteous Judge ſhall give unto me,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7,8. It follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And they took the body of Ieſus, and wrapped it in clean linnen,
<note place="margin">Mat. 27.59. &amp; Mar. 15.46. &amp; Luke
23.53. &amp; John 19.40.</note> with the ſpices, at the manner of the</hi> Jews <hi>is to bury. Now there was a garden in the place where he was crucified, and in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a new ſepulchre which</hi> Joſeph <hi>had hewen out of the Rock for himſelf, in which was never man yet laid. There laid they Ieſus therefore becauſe of the</hi> Jews <hi>preparation day, and the Sabbath drew on. And they rolled a great ſtone upon the mouth of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, and departed. And there were</hi> Mary Magdalen, <hi>and</hi> Mary <hi>the mother of</hi> Joſes, <hi>ſitting over againſt the ſepulchre, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where he was laid. And they returned, and prepared ſpices and oyntments: and reſted the Sabbath day, according to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wicked get them gone, and Jeſus is now left to the godly, but crucified. Theſe two therefore take the body of Jeſus for a great Reward and Treaſure; nor are they aſhamed to take him down from the croſs or gallows when he was dead, whom they loved ſo dearly when he was alive. Nor do they regard what others ſay of them, that ſuch Noble men ſhould undertake ſo mean a ſervice: but ſlighting all thoſe things, they take down
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:171778:255"/> Chriſts body from the croſs with much weeping and many tears queſtionleſs. Thus, my Brethren, if we would be Chriſtians and true Goſpellers indeed, we muſt not be aſhamed of ſuch low and mean employments.</p>
                  <p>They wrap Chriſts body in clean linnen; for ſo it became this pureſt body to be ſhrouded, which was ſo clean that the very linnen was the cleaner for it. They add alſo Oyntments and Spices, which the
<hi>Jews</hi> uſed to keep the bodies from rotting. And this ſhewed that thoſe two had yet but a weak and imperfect Faith. For they had no higher thoughts of Chriſt, but that he was an honeſt and innocent man, and a Prophet. But Chriſt was alſo God, which they knew not, and he was ſuddenly to riſe again, therefore had no need to be ſo embalmed. Nevertheleſs he was pleaſed to have this done, that his death might be more glorious, and that we might learn from hence how we ought to receive Chriſt; to wit, with clean linnen and Spices; that is, with a pure heart, and a ſweet and ſavory converſation.</p>
                  <p>But if any <hi>Judas</hi> had been here preſent, without doubt he would have exclaimed, as the other <hi>Iudas</hi> ſaid before,
<hi>Why was this waſte?</hi> Mar. 11.14. Theſe Spices might have been ſold for much, and given to the poor. What good will it do Chriſt to perſume him with Spices when he was dead? But a Chriſtian ought not to ſay this coſt is ſuperfluous. For the charges of thoſe men is not ſo much to be conſidered as their Faith. That only is loſt which is not done in Faith. But here was nothing leſs then loſs. It was rather truly a good work, whereby thoſe two declared their faith, and openly ſhewed that they would hazard all they had for Chriſt. For they muſt of neceſſity expect to be the hatred of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> and unavoidably look for the ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all their goods for ſo doing. It was a great work, and not to be compared with any works of Hypocrites. For Hypocrites indeed are at great expences, but they do nothing out of Faith &amp; abnegation of their goods: but all proceeds from impiety and ambition of gain. But no work is to be rated or valued accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the coſtlineſs or outward ſhew of it, but according to the faith of him that doth it. Thus the Widow in the Goſpel that caſt in her two Mites is ſaid to offer more then all the reſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe did it out of her faith and poverty, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="415" facs="tcp:171778:255"/> So this work was not ſo great from the coſt, but from the Faith, whereby they did now renounce and hazard all the reſt of their goods for Chriſt. Moreover it is manifeſt by their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives what is was that they ſought for in Chriſt. For Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives keep the body from putrefaction. It was life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forre which they ſought after in Chriſt. But how? under death, in a dry body: and this indeed is true Faith. Every body will ſeek life in a living Chriſt, this is eaſie: but to look for any thing in a dead, dry deſpiſed Chriſt,
<hi>hoc opus, hic labor eſt,</hi> is hard to be done.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> do not deſcribe the manner only of Chriſts burial, but the place alſo; <hi>There was,</hi> ſaith he,
<hi>a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den hard by.</hi> Theſe things ſeem to fall out by chance, but indeed all things were thus ordered by Divine Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Chriſt began his Paſſion in a Garden, and in a Garden he finiſhed the ſame, becauſe <hi>Adam</hi> ſinned in a garden. Chriſt was alſo buried in a garden, to ſhew that by him there is a way open for us to return into Paradiſe, not into an earthly, but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas he was buried in another mans grave, that ſhews his povery, who neither in his life, nor in his death <hi>had where to lay his head,</hi> Mat. 8. Here alſo our curioſity is condemned, who with ſuch care and coſt, yea with ſo much pride do build Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchres for our ſelves. But it is ſignificantly ſaid of Chriſts Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, that it was a new one, and that none was ever buried in it before, to take away all ſuſpition, leſt it ſhould be thought that any other roſe out of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As Chriſt prepared a Virgin-womb for himſelf when he was to be born, which never man knew; ſo when he was to riſe again, he would be buried in a new Sepulchre, wherein never man was yet laid. Which new Sepulchre,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Did prefigure, that ſome new and unheard of thing was to be done; to wit, that he who was buried in that grave ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn again to life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Alſo that Death was to be turned into a ſleep, eſpecially as to the godly: out of which ſleep they were to riſe again in due time as in a moſt pleaſant and delicious garden.

                     </note>Note that we
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:171778:256"/> do not read of any one Diſciple that was preſent at the butial of Chriſt (though tis to be believed that
<hi>John</hi> was there, which yet by the letter doth not appear) leſt it ſhould be thought that they had carried away the body of Jeſus, and hid it in ſome other place. Finally, thoſe good men rolled a great ſtone to the mouth of the Sepulchre.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Jews</hi> might not eaſily offer any violence to the dead body. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That his Reſurrection might be the more clear and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in that he could come forth when the Sepulchre was faſt ſhut up.</p>
                  <p>Thus honour then of ſuch a Funeral Chriſt ſuffered to be done unto him by theſe Honourable men, that his enemies might not ſay, none but baſe and worthleſs men did ſtick to this <hi>Nazarene;</hi> although this was but a ſmall Honour, if compared to that wherewith he is now Honoured in all the Earth, and in all the Churches, not only as man, but as God and man; who doth no longer lie in the grave, but ſitteth at the right hand of God in Heaven. Notwithſtanding his Sepulchre is ſo Honourable to this very day, that not only Chriſtians, but many <hi>Gentiles</hi> alſo come out of admiration very far to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to ſee it. In ſhort, the Sepulchre of <hi>Moſes</hi> is not known where it is: nor doth it much matter where he was buried: but all know where the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre of Chriſt is; for ſo it is neceſſary, that by it we ſhould learn both our own burial and reſurrection. For as the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt are ours; ſo alſo is the burial of Chriſt ours. <hi>For we are buried with him by baptiſm into death,</hi> Rom. 6.4. Laſtly, It is ſaid, that thoſe women of <hi>Galile obſerved the place where he was buried.</hi> For they intended to anoint and perfume his body very carefully. They did not judge it meet that ſo holy a body ſhould putrifie and be eaten up of Worms. For neither did they know that he was God, and that he was ſhortly to riſe again. It follows in the Text.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation,

<note place="margin">Mat. 27.62.</note> the chief Prieſts and Phariſees came together unto</hi> Pilate, <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Sir, we remember that that deceiver ſaid, while he was yet alive, After three dayes I will riſe again. Command there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Sepulchre be made ſure untill the third day, leſt
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:171778:256"/> his Diſciples come by night, and ſteal him away, and ſay unto the people, He is riſen from the dead: ſo the laſt Errour ſhall be vorye then the firſt.</hi> Pilate <hi>ſaid unto them, Ye have a watch, go your way, make it as ſure as you can. So they went and made the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre ſure, ſealing the ſtone, and ſetting a watch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wicked are not, nor can they yet be quiet although Chriſt were now dead and buried. They vex and trouble <hi>Pilate</hi> again, and importune him to make faſt the Sepulchre, for they were afraid that he had not given ſtrict charge enough. Now they underſtood the ſign of
<hi>Ionas</hi> which Chriſt ſaid ſhould be given them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. Now alſo they underſtood the deſtruction of the Temple which was to be raiſed up again in three dayes, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they wreſted it to another ſenſe before, when they accuſed Chriſt. Therefore now they run headlong together again, even on that their Sabbath, when the other <hi>Jews</hi> mean while were at their devotion and prayers. They can neither reſt themſelves, nor can <hi>Pilate</hi> be at quiet for them. Such great Signs were there ſhewed at the death of this juſt man, that they might very well have done otherwiſe. But theſe ſigns had the ſame effect upon theſe men, as thoſe great Miracles heretofore took upon the <hi>Aegyptians.</hi> They were only thereby more hardened. Well might they fear that the laſt errour would be worſe then the firſt. They ſpeak true at unawares, and propheſie againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. For their miſtake was worſe, and they did err more, in that they did not repent afterward. But the Faith of Believers was thereupon the more confirmed concerning the truth of the Reſurrection. Having therefore got leave of <hi>Pilate,</hi> they make ſure the Sepulchre, ſetting a watch: and not content with this, they ſeal the ſtone too. Thus Humane prudence ſtrives againſt God, but all in vain. For Chriſt will riſe again in ſpite of your reeth, O ye <hi>Phariſees,</hi> nor can the Souldiers or ſealing the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchte hinder it one jott. All the endeavours of mans pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are to no purpoſe, where God hath otherwiſe decreed. Take to you all the ſtrength of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> yet ſhall you not be able to keep this <hi>Nazarene</hi> in the grave. All the care and pains which they take about the ſepulchre, they take againſt themſelves. And it was Divine Providence, that the Sepulchre ſhould be made ſo faſt. For hence the truth of his Reſurrection is more clearly

Here then diligently again remember the Divine chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Power, in that it doth moſt wiſely accompliſh his own, by anothers work. <hi>Caiaphas</hi> thought it fit that Chriſt ſhould be put to death and periſh; but God ſaw it needful that Chriſt ſhould be the life of the world. God therefore made uſe of the work of wicked <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> and by it accompliſhed his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Thus alſo it was the prudence of the <hi>Iews</hi> to ſet a watch upon the Sepulchre, leſt any ſhould ſteal away the body from thence, and tell the people that he was riſen. But it was the Wiſdom of God, that the Reſurrection of Chriſt ſhould be made moſt manifeſt to all men. God therefore doth take the deſign of others prudence to perfect thereby and compleat his own Purpoſe and Deſign. For by this ſtrict and narrow watch the Reſurrection is made much more clear and manifeſt, then if the
<hi>Iews</hi> had not ſo diligently guarded the Sepulchre.</p>

               <p>HItherto we have heard, how many and how great things the Creator and Lord of the world ſuffered from ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ſuch great men, who were ſo mad and did ſo cruelly rage againſt him, that he might ſatisfie the Divine Juſtice for ſo many and ſuch great and miſerable puniſhments which were due to our ſins.
